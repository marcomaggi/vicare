1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a distribution of C and Scheme libraries for
Vicare Scheme,  an R6RS compliant  Scheme implementation; it
provides bindings for the Template C language library.

  The  last   time  the  author  bothered   to  update  this
paragraph, he had tested Template version 1.2.3.

  This package makes use of the GNU Autotools.

3. Install
----------

Before  installing  Vicare/Template  make  sure  to  have  a
correctly   installed    Template   library.    To   install
Vicare/Template do this:

   $ cd vicare-template-0.1.0
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure --enable-shared --disable-static
   $ make
   $ make check
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/vicare-template

  After  installation, the  makefile  rule "vfasl-installed"
will  precompile the  libraries installed  in  the hierarchy
(vicare template ---).
