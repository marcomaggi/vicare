;;;Contents: tests for issue 21, delete character is printed unescaped
;;;Date: Mon Jun 13, 2011
;;;
;;;Abstract
;;;
;;;	Reported by GÃ¶ran Weinholt.
;;;
;;;	  The DEL  character is  printed unescaped.  It's  not generally
;;;	considered  printable,   and  on  my  terminal   it  looks  like
;;;	whitespace for some reason.
;;;
;;;		> "\x7f;"
;;;		""
;;;
;;;	  It  happens only  when  the #\delete  character  appears in  a
;;;	string.
