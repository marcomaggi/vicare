;;;; Introduction to Unicode and UCS
;;
;;As  required  by  R6RS,  the  input/output  libraries  must  implement
;;transcoders for textual ports supporting encoding and decoding between
;;Scheme characters and UTF-8 and UTF-16.
;;
;;The  mandatory starting  points  to  learn about  this  stuff are  the
;;following (URLs last verified on Sep 9, 2011):
;;
;;  <http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html>
;;  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Character_Set>
;;  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode>
;;  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark>
;;  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>
;;  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16>
;;  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32>
;;
;;here we  give only a brief  overview of the  main definitions, drawing
;;text from those pages.
;;
;;The "Universal  Character Set" (UCS)  is a standard set  of characters
;;upon which  many character encodings  are based; it  contains abstract
;;characters,  each identified  by an  unambiguous name  and  an integer
;;number called its "code point".
;;
;;"Unicode"  is  a  computing   industry  standard  for  the  consistent
;;encoding, representation and handling of text expressed in most of the
;;world's writing systems.
;;
;;UCS and  Unicode have  an identical repertoire  and numbers:  the same
;;characters with  the same numbers exist  in both standards.   UCS is a
;;simple character map, Unicode  adds rules for collation, normalization
;;of forms, and the bidirectional algorithm for scripts.
;;
;;The  Unicode Consortium, the  nonprofit organization  that coordinates
;;Unicode's development,  has the goal of  eventually replacing existing
;;character  encoding schemes  with  Unicode and  its standard  "Unicode
;;Transformation  Format"   alias  "UCS  Transformation   Format"  (UTF)
;;schemes.

;;By  convention a Unicode  code point  is referred  to by  writing "U+"
;;followed by its  hexadecimal number with at least  4 digits (U+0044 is
;;fine, U+12 is not).
;;
;;In practice, Unicode  code points are exact integers  in the range [0,
;;#x10FFFF], but  outside the range  [#xD800, #xDFFF] which  has special
;;meaning in UTF schemes.  A code point can be stored in 21 bits:
;;
;;  (string-length (number->string #x10FFFF 2)) => 21
;;
;;R6RS defines  fixnums to have  at least 24  bits, so a fixnum  is wide
;;enough to hold a code point:
;;
;;  (fixnum? #x10FFFF) => #t
;;
;;and indeed Scheme characters are a disjoint type of value holding such
;;fixnums:
;;
;;  (integer->char #x10FFFF) => #\x10FFFF

;;;; UTF-8 scheme
;;
;;UTF-8  is  a  multioctet  character  encoding for  Unicode  which  can
;;represent every character in the Unicode set, that is it can represent
;;every code point in the ranges [0, #xD800) and (#xDFFF, #x10FFFF].
;;
;;A stream  of UTF-8 encoded characters  is meant to be  stored octet by
;;octet  in  fixed  order  (and  so  without the  need  to  specify  the
;;endianness of words).
;;
;;The encoding scheme uses sequences of 1,  2, 3 or 4 octets to encode a
;;each code point as shown in  the following table; the first octet in a
;;sequence has a unique bit pattern  in the most significant bits and so
;;it  allows  the determination  of  the  sequence  length; every  octet
;;contains a number of payload  bits which must be concatenated (bitwise
;;inclusive  OR) to  reconstruct the  integer representation  of  a code
;;point:
;;
;; | # of octets | 1st octet | 2nd octet | 3rd octet | 4th octet |
;; |-------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------|
;; |     1        #b0xxxxxxx
;; |     2        #b110xxxxx  #b10xxxxxx
;; |     3        #b1110xxxx  #b10xxxxxx  #b10xxxxxx
;; |     4        #b11110xxx  #b10xxxxxx  #b10xxxxxx  #b10xxxxxx
;;
;; | # of octets | # of payload bits |       hex range     |
;; |-------------+-------------------+---------------------|
;; |     1                         7    [#x0000,   #x007F]
;; |     2                5 + 6 = 11    [#x0080,   #x07FF]
;; |     3            4 + 6 + 6 = 16    [#x0800,   #xFFFF]
;; |     4        3 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 21  [#x010000, #x10FFFF]
;;
;;Note that  octets #xFE  and #xFF  cannot appear in  a valid  stream of
;;UTF-8 encoded  characters.  The sequence of  3 octets is  the one that
;;could encode (but must not) the forbidden range [#xD800, #xDFFF].
;;
;;The  first 128  characters  of the  Unicode  character set  correspond
;;one-to-one with  ASCII and are encoded  using a single  octet with the
;;same binary  value as the corresponding ASCII  character, making valid
;;ASCII text  valid UTF-8  encoded Unicode text  as well.   Such encoded
;;octets have the Most Significant Bit (MSB) set to zero.
;;
;;Although the standard does not  define it, many programs start a UTF-8
;;stream with  a Byte Order Mark  (BOM) composed of the  3 octets: #xEF,
;;#xBB, #xBF.
;;

;;The following  macro definitions assume  that the OCTET  arguments are
;;fixnums representing 1  octet (they are in the  range [0, 255]), while
;;the CODE-POINT arguments are  fixnums representing Unicode code points
;;(they are in  the range [0, #x10FFFF], but  outside the range [#xD800,
;;#xDFFF]).

;;;; ISO/IEC 8859-1 also known as Latin-1
;;
;;Latin-1 uses 1 octet per character.  The first 256 Unicode code points
;;are identical  to the content of  Latin-1, the first  127 Latin-1 code
;;points are identical to ASCII.  For an itroduction see:
;;
;;  <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1>
;;
;;Latin-1 code points are identical to their octet encoding.
;;
;;Latin-1 code  points in the range  [0, 127] are identical  to the same
;;code points encoded in both ASCII and in UTF-8.
;;
;;Latin-1 code points  in the range [128, 255]  are *different* from the
;;same code points encoded in UTF-8.
;;
;;Every  octet (that  is: every  fixnum in  the range  [0, 255])  can be
;;interpreted as a character in Latin-1 encoding.
;;

;;In the  following macros the  argument OCTET is  meant to be  a fixnum
;;representing a octet, while the argument CODE-POINT is meant to be the
;;integer representation of a character.
