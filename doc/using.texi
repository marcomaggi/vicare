The synopsis of the @value{EXECUTABLE} program is as follows:

@smallexample
@value{RAWEXECUTABLE} [@var{OPTIONS}] [PROGRAM]                      [-- [@var{PROGRAM OPTS}]]
@value{RAWEXECUTABLE} [@var{OPTIONS}] --r6rs-script PROGRAM          [-- [@var{PROGRAM OPTS}]]
@value{RAWEXECUTABLE} [@var{OPTIONS}] --r6rs-repl PROGRAM            [-- [@var{PROGRAM OPTS}]]
@value{RAWEXECUTABLE} [@var{OPTIONS}] --script CODE                  [-- [@var{PROGRAM OPTS}]]
@value{RAWEXECUTABLE} [@var{OPTIONS}] --compile-dependencies PROGRAM [-- [@var{PROGRAM OPTS}]]
@end smallexample

@noindent
the @var{OPTIONS} are interpreted by @value{EXECUTABLE}, @var{PROGRAM
OPTS} can be obtained using the @func{command-line} procedure in the
@library{rnrs programs} library; when running the @repl{}: the first
element of the returned list will be the string @samp{*interactive*},
corresponding to the script name in @rnrs{6}--script mode.

Some options cause code to be evaluated in the interaction environment:
it initially contains all the bindings exported from the
@library{ikarus} library.

The @value{EXECUTABLE} executable recognises a few command line switches
that influence how @value{PACKAGE} starts; the following are the main
options, driving the execution mode.  It is an error to put on the
command line two or more of these options.

@table @code
@item --r6rs-script @var{PROGRAM}
Start Vicare in @rnrs{6}--script mode.  The @var{PROGRAM} file is handled
as an @rnrs{6} program.  Example:

@example
$ cat test.sps
(import (rnrs))
(write (command-line))
(newline)

$ @value{RAWEXECUTABLE} --r6rs-script test.sps hi there
("test.sps" "hi" "there")
@end example

@item --r6rs-repl @var{PROGRAM}
Start Vicare in @rnrs{6}-script mode.  Act as if the
@option{--r6rs-script} option had been used but, after the program
execution, enter the @repl{} rather than exiting.  This allows
inspection of bindings and state left behind by the program.

@item --script @var{CODEFILE}
Start Vicare in evaluation mode.  The @var{CODEFILE} is handled as a
sequence of @rnrs{6} expressions: such expressions are used as first
argument for @func{eval} under the interaction environment.  Example:

@example
$ cat test.sps
(write (command-line))
(newline)

$ @value{RAWEXECUTABLE} --script test.sps hi there
("test.sps" "hi" "there")
@end example

@item --compile-dependencies @var{IMPORTS-FILE}
Load the @rnrs{6} program @var{IMPORTS-FILE}, compile all the libraries
upon which it depends and store them in the FASL repository.
@var{IMPORTS-FILE} itself is not evaluated.
@end table

When none of these options is given, but a standalone @var{PROGRAM}
argument is present on the command line: act as if the
@option{--r6rs-script} option had been used with the given file name.
If no standalone @var{PROGRAM} argument is present: enter the @repl{}.

The rest of the command line arguments are recognised by the standard
Scheme run time system.

@table @code
@item -b path/to/boot/file.boot
@itemx --boot path/to/boot/file.boot
Use the specified boot file as the initial system boot file.  The boot
file is a binary file that contains all the code and data of the Scheme
system.  In the absence of the @option{-b} flag, the executable will use
the default boot file.  Running @value{EXECUTABLE} with the @option{-h}
option shows the location where the default boot file was installed.

@item --no-rcfile
Disable loading of run--command files.

@item --rcfile @var{FILE}
Load and evaluate @var{FILE} as an @rnrs{6} program at startup, before
loading libraries, evaluating codes and running the main script.  This
option can be used multiple times.

@item -l @var{LIBFILE}
@itemx --load-library @var{LIBFILE}
Load @var{libfile} expecting it to contain one or more @rnrs{6}
libraries; after executing the RC files, load the libraries in the
internal collection, but do not add them to any environment.  This
option can be used multiple times.

@item -f @var{CODEFILE}
@itemx --eval-file @var{CODEFILE}
Load @var{CODEFILE} expecting it to contain valid @rnrs{6} expressions;
after instantiating the libraries hand the code to @func{eval} under the
interaction environment.  Bindings left behind by this code are
available if we enter the @repl{}.  This option can be used multiple
times.

@item -e @var{EXPRESSION}
@itemx --eval-expr @var{EXPRESSION}
After instantiating the libraries hand the @var{EXPRESSION} to
@func{eval} under the interaction environment.  Bindings left behind by
this code are available if we enter the @repl{}. This option can be used
multiple times.

@item -L @var{DIRECTORY}
@itemx --search-path @var{DIRECTORY}
Add @var{DIRECTORY} to the library search path.  This option can be used
multiple times.

@item --fasl-path @var{DIRECTORY}
Add @var{DIRECTORY} to the @fasl{} search path.  This option can be used
multiple times.

@item --fasl-directory @var{DIRECTORY}
Select @var{DIRECTORY} as top pathname under which @fasl{} files are
stored when libraries are compiled; @var{DIRECTORY} must exist.  When
used multiple times: the last one wins.  The selected directory is
always prepended to the @fasl{} search path.

@item --more-file-extensions
Rather than searching only libraries with extension @samp{.vicare.sls}
and @samp{.sls}, search also for @samp{.vicare.ss}, @samp{.ss},
@samp{.vicare.scm}, @samp{.scm} and the @samp{main} file.  @ref{using
libraries searching} for more details.

@item --prompt @var{STRING}
Use @var{STRING} as prompt for the @repl{}.  Defaults to @samp{vicare},
to which the character @samp{>} is appended for each nested @repl{}
level.  @ref{iklib cafe} for more details.

@item --repl-on-sigint
When this option is used an interprocess signal handler is registered at
program startup to enter a debugging @repl{} whenever a @code{SIGINT}
signal is received.

@item --raw-repl
Do not create a readline console input port even if the readline
interface is available.

@item -d
@itemx -g
@itemx --debug
Turn on debugging mode.  With this unhandled exceptions in the program
will result in starting the debugger, which allows stack trace
inspection.

@item -nd
@itemx --no-debug
Turn off debugging mode.

@item --print-loaded-libraries
Whenever a library file is loaded print a message on the console error
port.  This is for debugging purposes.

@item --no-print-loaded-libraries
Disables the effect of @option{--print-loaded-libraries}.

@item -O0
Turn off use of the source optimizer.

@item -O1
@itemx -O2
@itemx -O3
Turn on various levels of compile optimisations.

@item --optimizer-passes-count @var{COUNT}
Specify how many passes to perform with the source optimizer.  Must be a
positive fixnum.  Defaults to 1.

@item --enable-open-mvcalls
@itemx --disable-open-mvcalls
Enable or disable inlining of calls to @func{call-with-values}.
Defaults to disable.

@item --print-assembly
Print to the current error port the assembly instructions generated when
compiling code.

@item --print-optimizer
@itemx --print-optimiser
Print to the current error port a symbolic expression which results from
running the optimiser.

@item -V
@itemx --version
Display the version message then exit.

@item --version-only
Display only the version number on the standard error port, followed by
a newline, then exit.

@item --license
Display the license message then exit.

@item -h
@itemx --help
Display the help message then exit.

@item --
Mark the end of @value{EXECUTABLE} options; all the arguments after this
marker can be obtained by calling the @func{command-line} procedure.
@end table

@cindex @env{VICARE_RC_FILES}
If neither the @option{--no-rcfile} nor the @option{--rcfile} options
are used: a list of run--command files is read from the environment
variable @env{VICARE_RC_FILES}, which must contain a colon separated
list of pathnames.  If the enviroment variable is empty or unset, by
default the file @file{.vicarerc} is used searching it in the directory
selected by the @env{HOME} environment variable.

@node using script
@section Using @command{scheme-script}


Scheme scripts can be executed using the following command:

@example
@value{RAWEXECUTABLE} @var{PROGRAM}
@end example

@noindent
@value{PACKAGE} does @strong{not} follow the @rnrs{6} recommendations
and does not install a wrapper program called @command{scheme-script} to
avoid conflicts with other Scheme implementations.

Here is a sample script (Pig Latin---``Igpay Atinlay''---is a code that
was at one time popular among very young North American children).

@example
(import (rnrs))

;;; Convert a string to its Pig Latin equivalent.
;;;
;;; If the first character is a vowel, append "yay".
;;; "egg" -> "eggyay"
;;;
;;; If the first character is a consonant, remove it,
;;; and append it plus "ay" to the string.
;;; "foo" -> "oofay"

(define pig-latin
  (lambda (str)
    (let ((first (string-ref str 0)))
      (if (memv first '(#\a #\e #\i #\o #\u))
	  (string-append str "yay")
	  (string-append
 	    (substring str 1 (string-length str))
	    (string first) "ay")))))

(display
 (map pig-latin
     (cdr (command-line))))
(newline)
@end example

Assuming we have stored the script in the file @file{demo.sps}, we can
invoke this script via @value{EXECUTABLE}:

@example
$ @value{RAWEXECUTABLE} --r6rs-script demo.sps ice cream after dinner
(iceyay reamcay afteryay innerday)
@end example

On Unix/Linux systems, scripts generally start with a ``shebang'' line
(@emph{sh}arp plus @emph{bang}) which names an interpreter for the
script.  All modern systems have the @command{env} command which
searches for a command in the user's path.

@example
#!/usr/bin/env @value{RAWEXECUTABLE} --r6rs-script
(import (rnrs))

...
@end example

Now we can make the file executable, and use it directly.

@example
$ chmod +x demo.sps
$ ./demo.sps ice cream after dinner
(iceyay reamcay afteryay innerday)
@end example

There are a few fine points.

@itemize
@item
If the first two bytes of a script represent the sequence @samp{#!} in
@ascii{} encoding: the first line is discarded and not parsed as Scheme
code.  This allows scripts on Unix systems to start with the command
line needed to use them; notice that this will discard valid sharp--bang
comments (like @code{#!r6rs}) if the are at the very beginning of a
file.

@item
Under Mac OS X, if a script name ends with the @code{.command}
extension, then it can be executed from the Finder by double--clicking
on it.  This brings up a terminal window in which the script is
executed.  The @code{.command} extension can be hidden from the
@emph{Get Info} item from the Finder's File menu.

@section @rnrs{6} libraries


A library exports features that can be imported into programs; a library
is named by a list, e.g., @library{yoyodyne
block-transfer-computations}.  The core features of the language is
provided in the library @library{rnrs}.

@node using libraries intro
@subsection Introduction to libraries


A library consists of a ``file'' (some assemblage of text) that contains
a library form, which might look like this:

@example
(library (sample)
  (export cube)
  (import (rnrs))
  (define cube
    (lambda (x)
      (* x x x))))
@end example

@noindent
notice the @func{import} clause; libraries have no predefined namespace,
and therefore at least @library{rnrs} must be imported.

We can import @library{sample} into another library, a script, or a
@value{PRJNAME} top--level session:

@example
> (import (sample))
> (cube 3)
27
@end example

Library names are lists, thus allowing the writer of one or more
libraries to group related libraries together.  For example, as well as
@library{yoyodyne block-transfer-computations}, we might also have
@library{yoyodyne tardis navigation} and @library{yoyodyne tardis
diagnostics}.  Leaving the parentheses off a single--component library
name is a common error.

@c page
@node using libraries searching
@subsection How @value{PRJNAME} finds libraries


@findex library-path


In @value{PRJNAME}, a library is a file with the same name as the last
component of the library name.  For example, the library
@library{sample} will correspond to a file named @file{sample.sls}
somewhere in the file system.  The file extension @code{.sls} stands for
``Scheme library source''; although @value{PRJNAME} will also accept the
extensions @code{.ss} and @code{.scm} when the command line option
@option{--more-file-extensions} is used, these really indicate scripts
rather than libraries.

@value{PRJNAME} has a search algorithm for libraries that is similar to
those used in other languages.  @value{PRJNAME}'s search path comprises
a series of directories; when we try to import a library whose name
contains just one component, @value{PRJNAME} will examine each directory
in the search path for a file with a matching name.  Importing a library
whose name is a list of components causes @value{PRJNAME} to match to a
series of subdirectories with matching names.

Here is an example of each case:

@itemize
@item
Importing @library{sample} causes @value{PRJNAME} to look in each
directory on the path for a file named @file{sample.sls}.

@item
Importing @library{yoyodyne sample} causes @value{PRJNAME} to look in
each directory on the path for a directory named @file{yoyodyne}, and
within that a file named @file{sample.sls}.  The @func{library} form for
this library must still specify the library name as @library{yoyodyne
sample}, not @library{sample}.
@end itemize

@value{PRJNAME}'s own Scheme libraries and the boot image are installed
in the directory:

@example
$(libdir)/vicare-scheme
@end example

@noindent
for example on @gnu{}+Linux systems:

@example
/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme
@end example

@noindent
and are under the @library{vicare ---} and @library{srfi ---}
hierarchies; for example the library @library{vicare ffi} on
@gnu{}+Linux systems is installed as:

@example
/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme/vicare/ffi.sls
@end example

User libraries that are meant to be usable by @value{PRJNAME} should be
installed in the directory:

@example
$(libdir)/scheme/r6rs
@end example

@noindent
on @gnu{}+Linux systems:

@example
/usr/local/lib/scheme/r6rs
@end example

@cindex @env{VICARE_LIBRARY_PATH}
By default @value{PRJNAME} puts the following directories in the search
path, in this order:

@example
$(libdir)/scheme/r6rs
$(libdir)/vicare-scheme
@end example

@noindent
on @gnu{}+Linux systems:

@example
/usr/local/lib/scheme/r6rs
/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme
@end example

@noindent
other directories can be added to the search path in two ways: by
modifying an environment variable, or by setting @value{PRJNAME}'s
@func{library-path} parameter.  @value{PRJNAME} consults the environment
variable @env{VICARE_LIBRARY_PATH} at the beginning of execution, and
places each of the directories there into its search path.  The search
path is then set to the value of the parameter @func{library-path},
which can be updated as necessary.

In the following example session: the user sets
@env{VICARE_LIBRARY_PATH}; the settings are reflected in the value of
@code{(library-path)}; a further directory is then set during the
session:

@example
$ export VICARE_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/scheme:/tmp/library
$ echo $VICARE_LIBRARY_PATH
/home/marco/scheme:/tmp/library
$ @value{RAWEXECUTABLE}
...

> (library-path)
("/home/marco/scheme"
 "/tmp/library"
 "/usr/local/lib/scheme/r6rs"
 "/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme")
> (library-path (cons "/opt/sw/extra-libraries" (library-path)))
> (library-path)
("/opt/sw/extra-libraries"
 "/home/marco/scheme"
 "/tmp/library"
 "/usr/local/lib/scheme/r6rs"
 "/usr/local/lib/vicare-scheme")
@end example

In programs intended to be distributed, we should resist the urge to set
@code{(library-path)}, as the user's file hierarchies might not match
ours; for most libraries, simply telling the user to install the library
in one of the libraries on the search path is good enough.

There are two refinements of the library search algorithm, which are
performed when the @option{--more-file-extensions} command line option
is used.

@itemize
@item
A common pattern is to distribute a main library along with a number of
additional extensions: we might have a main library named @library{lib},
and additional optional extensions named @library{lib extras} and
@library{lib frills}.

Although the previous packaging method can be used, @value{PRJNAME}
allows us to use a simpler technique where the main library is stored in
@file{lib/main.sls}, and the extensions are stored in
@file{lib/extras.sls} and @file{lib/frills.sls}, respectively.

@item
@value{PRJNAME} will also look in @file{lib/main.vicare.sls} before
trying @file{lib/main.sls}.  This allows us to provide a
@value{PRJNAME}--specific implementation as well as a generic
implementation.
@end itemize

@c page
@node using libraries summary
@subsection Library search algorithm summary


By default, @value{PRJNAME} attempts to import the library @library{a b
c} as follows, for each directory in the search path:

@enumerate
@item
Build the rootname @file{a/b/c}.

@item
Append each of the following strings to the rootname, in order, until a
matching file is found:

@example
.vicare.sls
.sls
@end example
@end enumerate

When the the command line option @option{--more-file-extensions} is
used, for each directory in the search path:

@enumerate
@item
Build the rootname @file{a/b/c}.

@item
Append each of the following strings to the rootname, in order, until a
matching file is found:

@example
/main.vicare.sls
/main.vicare.ss
/main.vicare.scm
/main.sls
/main.ss
/main.scm
.vicare.sls
.vicare.ss
.vicare.scm
.sls
.ss
.scm
@end example
@end enumerate

If there is no match, then the import request is in error.

Whenever the library name component @code{main} appears as last and not
unique component: when building the file rootname such component is
``quoted'' by appending an underscore character; examples:

@example
(alpha beta main)       @result{} "alpha/beta/main_"
(main alpha)            @result{} "main/alpha"
(main)                  @result{} "main"
@end example

@subsection Examples of library usage


Consider a program using @func{pretty-print} procedure to format some
code, and suppose further that pretty printing is just a nice add--on
(e.g. using @file{write} suffices, but pretty--printing is @emph{just
prettier}).

@value{PRJNAME} exports a good pretty--printing facility in its
@library{ikarus} library.  However, since @func{pretty-print} is not a
standard procedure, a program that uses it would be rendered unportable
to other @rnrs{6} Scheme implementations.

The programmer can put the @code{.vicare.*} extensions to use in this
situation, by writing two versions of a @library{pretty-printing}
library: one for use by @value{PRJNAME}, and one portable for other
implementations.

@example
;; pretty-printing.vicare.ss --
;;
;; Can be used only by @value{PRJNAME} Scheme.

(library (pretty-printing)
  (export pretty-print)
  (import (only (ikarus) pretty-print)))

;;; end of file
@end example

@example
;; pretty-printing.sls --
;;
;; For any other Scheme implementation, portable though
;; not very pretty.

(library (pretty-printing)
  (export pretty-print)
  (import (rnrs))
  (define (pretty-print x port)
    (write x port)
    (newline port)))

;;; end of file

@section Using @command{rlwrap}

While @value{PRJNAME} comes with an interface to @gnu{} Readline or

only very basic editing capabilities.  For this reason it is suggested
to use @command{rlwrap}:

@section Launching programs on Linux


When running @value{PRJNAME} on a @gnu{}+Linux system we can take
advantage of the features offered by the @code{binfmt_misc} kernel
module to launch directly executable programs without prefixing the
program name with the @command{vicare} executable.

It all comes down to this: after setting up the feature as explained in
the appendix @ref{binfmt}, we write a file containing:

@example
;;;!vicare
(import (only (program-library) main))
(main)
@end example

@noindent
where @library{program-library} is an installed library containing the
application code and @func{main} is the function that starts the
application.  If we enable executable permissions for the file and make
sure that the first bytes in the file are the sequence
@code{;;;!vicare}, we can configure the Linux kernel to start the
program handing its command line to the executable @command{vicare}.

@c end of file
