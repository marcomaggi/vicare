@cindex Library @library{vicare containers queues}


The library @library{vicare containers queues} implements queues holding
arbitrary scheme objects and designed for efficient first--in/first--out
operations.

The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
containers queues}.


@deftp {@rnrs{6} Record Type} queue
@cindex @var{queue} argument
@cindex Argument @var{queue}
Record type representing a queue object.  The @objtype{queue} type is
non--generative and available for subtyping.  In this documentation
@objtype{queue} object arguments to functions are indicated as
@var{queue}.
@end deftp


@defun make-queue @var{obj} @dots{}
Build and return a @objtype{queue} object holding the given objects,
which are pushed on the queue from left to right.
@end defun


@defun queue? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a record of type @objtype{queue};
otherwise return @false{}.
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Object properties


@defun queue-putprop @var{queue} @var{key} @var{value}
@defunx $queue-putprop @var{queue} @var{key} @var{value}
Add a new property @var{key} to the property list of @var{queue};
@var{key} must be a symbol.  If @var{key} is already set: the old entry
is mutated to reference the new @var{value}.
@end defun


@defun queue-getprop @var{queue} @var{key}
@defunx $queue-getprop @var{queue} @var{key}
Return the value of the property @var{key} in the property list of
@var{queue}; if @var{key} is not set: return @false{}.  @var{key} must
be a symbol.
@end defun


@defun queue-remprop @var{queue} @var{key}
@defunx $queue-remprop @var{queue} @var{key}
Remove the property @var{key} from the property list of @var{queue}; if
@var{key} is not set: nothing happens.  @var{key} must be a symbol.
@end defun


@defun queue-property-list @var{queue}
@defunx $queue-property-list @var{queue}
Return a new association list representing the property list of
@var{queue}.  The order of the entries is the same as the property
creation order.
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Other operations


@defun queue-hash @var{queue}
@defunx $queue-hash @var{queue}
Return an exact integer to be used as hashtable key for @var{queue}.
Hashtables having a @objtype{queue} as key can be instantiated as
follows:

@example
(make-hashtable queue-hash eq?)
@end example
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Arguments validation


The following bindings are meant to be used with the facilities of the
library @library{vicare arguments validation}.


@deffn {Validation Clause} queue @var{obj}
@deffnx {Validation Clause} queue/false @var{obj}
Succeed if @var{obj} satisfies the predicate @func{queue?}; the second
clause also accepts @false{}.
@end deffn

@c page
@node queues inspection
@section Inspecting queue objects


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
containers queues}.  The bindings whose name is prefixed with @code{$}
are unsafe operations: they do @strong{not} validate their arguments
before accessing them.


@defun queue-empty? @var{queue}
@defunx $queue-empty? @var{queue}
Return @true{} if @var{queue} is empty; otherwise return @false{}.
@end defun


@defun queue-not-empty? @var{queue}
@defunx $queue-not-empty? @var{queue}
Return @true{} if @var{queue} is @strong{not} empty; otherwise return
@false{}.
@end defun


@defun queue-size? @var{queue}
@defunx $queue-size? @var{queue}
Return an exact integer representing the number of objects in @var{queue}.
@end defun

@c page
@node queues access
@section Queue accessors and mutators


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
containers queues}.  The bindings whose name is prefixed with @code{$}
are unsafe operations: they do @strong{not} validate their arguments
before accessing them.


@defun queue-front @var{queue}
@defunx $queue-front @var{queue}
Return the object at the front of the queue.  Raise an assertion violation
if @var{queue} is empty.
@end defun


@defun queue-rear @var{queue}
@defunx $queue-rear @var{queue}
Return the object at the rear of the queue.  Raise an assertion
violation if @var{queue} is empty.
@end defun


@defun queue-push! @var{queue} @var{obj}
@defunx $queue-push! @var{queue} @var{obj}
Push @var{obj} on the @var{queue}.
@end defun


@defun queue-pop! @var{queue}
@defunx $queue-pop! @var{queue}
Remove the object at the front of the queue and return it.  Raise an
assertion violation if @var{queue} is empty.
@end defun

@c page
@node queues conversion
@section Converting queues to other objects


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
containers queues}.  The bindings whose name is prefixed with @code{$}
are unsafe operations: they do @strong{not} validate their arguments
before accessing them.


@defun queue->list @var{queue}
@defunx list->queue @var{list}
Convert to and from a queue and a proper list.  Objects from the list
are pushed on the queue from left to right.
@end defun


@defun queue->vector @var{queue}
@defunx vector->queue @var{vector}
Convert to and from a queue and a vector.
@end defun
