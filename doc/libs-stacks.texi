@cindex Library @library{vicare containers stacks}


The library @library{vicare containers stacks} implements stacks holding
arbitrary scheme objects and designed for efficient last--in/first--out
operations.

@section Stack objects


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
containers stacks}.


@deftp {@rnrs{6} Record Type} stack
@cindex @var{stack} argument
@cindex Argument @var{stack}
Record type representing a stack object.  The @objtype{stack} type is
non--generative and available for subtyping.  In this documentation
@objtype{stack} object arguments to functions are indicated as
@var{stack}.
@end deftp


@defun make-stack @var{obj} @dots{}
Build and return a @objtype{stack} object holding the given objects,
which are pushed on the stack from right to left.
@end defun


@defun stack? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a record of type @objtype{stack};
otherwise return @false{}.
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Object properties


@defun stack-putprop @var{stack} @var{key} @var{value}
@defunx $stack-putprop @var{stack} @var{key} @var{value}
Add a new property @var{key} to the property list of @var{stack};
@var{key} must be a symbol.  If @var{key} is already set: the old entry
is mutated to reference the new @var{value}.
@end defun


@defun stack-getprop @var{stack} @var{key}
@defunx $stack-getprop @var{stack} @var{key}
Return the value of the property @var{key} in the property list of
@var{stack}; if @var{key} is not set: return @false{}.  @var{key} must
be a symbol.
@end defun


@defun stack-remprop @var{stack} @var{key}
@defunx $stack-remprop @var{stack} @var{key}
Remove the property @var{key} from the property list of @var{stack}; if
@var{key} is not set: nothing happens.  @var{key} must be a symbol.
@end defun


@defun stack-property-list @var{stack}
@defunx $stack-property-list @var{stack}
Return a new association list representing the property list of
@var{stack}.  The order of the entries is the same as the property
creation order.
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Other operations


@defun stack-hash @var{stack}
@defunx $stack-hash @var{stack}
Return an exact integer to be used as hashtable key for @var{stack}.
Hashtables having a @objtype{stack} as key can be instantiated as
follows:

@example
(make-hashtable stack-hash eq?)
@end example
@end defun

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Arguments validation


The following bindings are meant to be used with the facilities of the
library @library{vicare arguments validation}.


@deffn {Validation Clause} stack @var{obj}
@deffnx {Validation Clause} stack/false @var{obj}
Succeed if @var{obj} satisfies the predicate @func{stack?}; the second
clause also accepts @false{}.
@end deffn

@c page
@node stacks inspection
@section Inspecting stack objects


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
containers stacks}.  The bindings whose name is prefixed with @code{$}
are unsafe operations: they do @strong{not} validate their arguments
before accessing them.


@defun stack-empty? @var{stack}
@defunx $stack-empty? @var{stack}
Return @true{} if @var{stack} is empty; otherwise return @false{}.
@end defun


@defun stack-not-empty? @var{stack}
@defunx $stack-not-empty? @var{stack}
Return @true{} if @var{stack} is @strong{not} empty; otherwise return
@false{}.
@end defun


@defun stack-size? @var{stack}
@defunx $stack-size? @var{stack}
Return an exact integer representing the number of objects in @var{stack}.
@end defun

@c page
@node stacks access
@section Stack accessors and mutators


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
containers stacks}.  The bindings whose name is prefixed with @code{$}
are unsafe operations: they do @strong{not} validate their arguments
before accessing them.


@defun stack-top @var{stack}
@defunx $stack-top @var{stack}
Return the object at the top of the stack.  Raise an assertion violation
if @var{stack} is empty.
@end defun


@defun stack-push! @var{stack} @var{obj}
@defunx $stack-push! @var{stack} @var{obj}
Push @var{obj} on the @var{stack}.
@end defun


@defun stack-pop! @var{stack}
@defunx $stack-pop! @var{stack}
Remove the object at the top of the stack and return it.  Raise an
assertion violation if @var{stack} is empty.
@end defun

@c page
@node stacks conversion
@section Converting stacks to other objects


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
containers stacks}.  The bindings whose name is prefixed with @code{$}
are unsafe operations: they do @strong{not} validate their arguments
before accessing them.


@defun stack->list @var{stack}
@defunx list->stack @var{list}
Convert to and from a stack and a proper list.
@end defun


@defun stack->vector @var{stack}
@defunx vector->stack @var{vector}
Convert to and from a stack and a vector.
@end defun
