@subsection Grammar of Unix pathnames


A Unix pathname has the following grammar:

@example
pathname           = absolute-pathname
                   | relative-pathname

absolute-pathname  = "/" segment *( "/" segment )
relative-pathname  = segment-nz *( "/" segment )

segment            = *char
segment-nz         = 1*char

char               = [1, 255]
@end example

@noindent
where @math{[1, 255]} represents the octet interval between @math{1}
included and @math{255} included.  Notice that: an empty @code{pathname}
is invalid; an empty @code{segment} is valid and interpreted as
equivalent to a pathname segment representing the current directory
@samp{.}.

@subsection Predicates for Unix pathnames


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
parser-tools unix-pathnames}.


@defun pathname? @var{obj}
@defunx bytevector-pathname? @var{obj}
@defunx string-pathname? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a string or bytevector acceptable as
representation of a Unix pathname; otherwise return @false{}.  If
@var{obj} is neither string nor bytevector: return @false{}.
@end defun


@defun segment? @var{obj}

@subsection Converting Unix pathnames


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
parser-tools unix-pathnames}.


@defun string/bytevector->pathname-bytevector @var{obj}
@defunx string/bytevector->pathname-bytevector @var{obj} @var{who}
Convert the string or bytevector @var{obj} to a bytevector
representation of a pathname; when successful return a bytevector, if an
error occurs raise an exception with compound condition object of types:
@condition{unix-pathname-parser-error}, @condition{who},
@condition{message}, @condition{irritants} using the optional @var{who}
as value for the condition object of type @condition{who}.

When @var{obj} is a string: only characters whose Unicode code point is
in the range @math{[1, 255]} are accepted, notice that zero is excluded;
in this case a new bytevector is returned.  An empty string is
equivalent to a pathname segment representing the current directory: the
return value is @code{#vu8(46)}.

When @var{obj} is a bytevector: all the octets are accepted, with the
exception of the octet zero; in this case @var{obj} itself is returned.
An empty bytevector is equivalent to a pathname segment representing the
current directory: the return value is @code{#vu8(46)}.
@end defun


@defun pathname-bytevector->string @var{obj}
@defunx pathname-bytevector->string @var{obj} @var{who}
Convert the bytevector pathname representation @var{obj} to a string
pathname representation; when successful return a string, if an error
occurs raise an exception with compound condition object of types:
@condition{unix-pathname-parser-error}, @condition{who},
@condition{message}, @condition{irritants} using the optional @var{who}
as value for the condition object of type @condition{who}.  An empty
bytevector is equivalent to a bytevector representing the current
directory: the return value is @code{"."}.

All the octets in the bytevector are considered valid, with the
exception of the octet zero.

@subsection Parsing Unix pathnames


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
parser-tools unix-pathnames}.


@defun parse-segment @var{port}
Accumulate bytes from @var{port} while they are valid for a
@code{segment} component; notice that an empty @code{segment} is valid.

If @eof{} or a slash character in @ascii{} coding is read: return a
possibly empty bytevector holding the bytes accumulated so far; the port
position is left pointing to the byte after the last accumulated one.

If an invalid byte is read: an exception is raised using
@func{raise-unix-pathname-parser-error}; the port position is rewind to
the one before this function call.
@end defun


@defun parse-segment-nz @var{port}
Accumulate bytes from @var{port} while they are valid for a
@code{segment-nz} component; notice that an empty @code{segment-nz} is
not valid.

If the first read operation returns @eof{} or a slash character in
@ascii{} coding: the port position is restored to the one before this
function call and the return value is false.

If, after at least one valid byte is read, @eof{} or a slash is read:
return a bytevector holding the bytes accumulated so far; the port
position is left pointing to the byte after the last accumulated one.

If an invalid byte is read: an exception is raised using
@func{raise-unix-pathname-parser-error}; the port position is rewind to
the one before this function call.
@end defun


@defun parse-slash-and-segment @var{port}
Attempt to read from @var{port} the sequence slash character plus
@code{segment} component; notice that an empty @code{segment} is valid.

If these components are successfully read: return a bytevector holding
the accumulated @code{segment} bytes; if the @code{segment} component is
empty: the returned bytevector is normalised to hold a single byte
representing a dot in @ascii{} coding.  The port position is left
pointing to the byte after the last accumulated byte from the
@code{segment}.

If @eof{} or a valid byte different from slash is read as first byte:
return false; the port position is rewind to the one before this
function call.

If an invalid byte is read: an exception is raised using
@func{raise-unix-pathname-parser-error}; the port position is rewind to
the one before this function call.
@end defun


@defun parse-pathname @var{port}
Parse from @var{port} an absolute or relative pathname until @eof{} is
found; return two values: a boolean, @true{} if the pathname is
absolute; a possibly empty list of bytevectors representing the
segments.

If an invalid octet is read or @eof{} is read before any octet: an
exception is raised with @func{raise-unix-pathname-parser-error}; the
port position is rewind to the one before this function call.
@end defun

@node parser-tools unix-pathnames manip
@subsection Manipulating Unix pathnames


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
parser-tools unix-pathnames}.


@defun normalise-pathname @var{absolute?} @var{segments}
Given a list of bytevectors representing Unix pathname segments:
normalise them, as much as possible, removing segments representing
single--dot and double--dot directory entries; if @var{absolute?}  is
true: normalise @var{segments} as an absolute pathname, else normalise
it as a relative pathname.  Return two values:

@enumerate
@item
A boolean, @true{} if some change was made from @var{segments} to the
second return value; this allows us to detect if a normalised list of
segments when serialised into a bytevector becomes different from the
original bytevector that generated @var{segments}.

@item
A new, possibly empty, list of bytevectors representing the
normalisation of @var{segments}.  Absolute pathname segments can hold
neither single--dot nor double--dot segments: if a double--dot segment
cannot annihilate its previous segment, it is just discarded.
@end enumerate
@end defun


@defun serialise-segments @var{absolute?} @var{segments}
Given a possibly empty list of bytevectors representing pathname
segments build and return a new bytevector representing the full
pathname; if @var{absolute?} is true: the first byte of the result
represents a slash in @ascii{} coding.

If @var{segments} is null and @var{absolute?} is true: the returned
value is a bytevector holding a single byte representing a slash in
@ascii{} coding.

If @var{segments} is null and @var{absolute?} is false: the returned
value is a bytevector holding a single byte representing a dot in
@ascii{} coding.
@end defun

@subsection Components of Unix pathnames


The following bindings are exported by the library @library{vicare
parser-tools unix-pathnames}.


@defun pathname-extension @var{obj}
Return a new string or bytevector representing the extension of
@var{obj}, which must be a valid Unix pathname string or bytevector
representation.  The extension of a pathname is the sequence of
characters from the end up to the first dot character before the first
slash character; the returned value does @strong{not} include the dot
character and can be empty.

@example
#!vicare
(import (vicare)
  (prefix (vicare parser-tools unix-pathnames) uxptn.))

(define-syntax-rule (doit ?pathname)
  (uxptn.pathname-extension ?pathname))

(doit "ciao.it"                 @result{} "it"
(doit "ciao"                    @result{} ""
(doit "/path/to/file.ext"       @result{} "ext"
(doit "/path/to/file."          @result{} ""
(doit "/path/to/file"           @result{} ""
(doit "/path/to/file.ext/ab"    @result{} ""
(doit "/path/to/some.file.ext"  @result{} "ext"
(doit "ciao/"                   @result{} ""
