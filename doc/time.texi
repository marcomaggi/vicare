@subsection Abstract


Points in time are represented a the number of seconds (with nanosecond
precision) since ``the epoch'', a zero point in time.  Several standard
variants are defined, including @utc{} (Universal Coordinated Time),
@tai{} (international atomic time), and monotonic time.  A point in time
can also be represented as a Julian Day or Modified Julian Day number.

Time durations, including time spent in a process or thread, are
defined.  Conversion routines are provided.  The procedure
@func{current-time} queries the current time in a specified variant,
with a system--dependent resolution.  Procedures for time arithmetic and
time comparisons are also provided.

A date is a representation of a point in time in the Gregorian calendar,
a 24 hour clock (with nanosecond precision) and a time zone offset from
@utc{}.  Procedures for converting between time and dates are provided,
as well as for reading and writing string representations of dates.

@subsection Rationale


@rnrs{5} Scheme does not provide standard data types for time.  This
@srfi{} addresses this lack by specifying data types for time and

@node srfi time spec intro
@appendixsubsubsec Introduction


A @emph{Time} object, which is distinct from all existing types, defines
a point in time or a time duration in some standard time system.  The
standard time systems are:

@itemize
@item
Universal Coordinated Time (@utc{}),

@item
International Atomic Time (@tai{}),

@item
monotonic time (a monotonically increasing point in time from some
epoch, which is implementation--dependent),

@item
@cpu{} time in current thread (implementation dependent),

@item
@cpu{} time in current process (implementation dependent),

@item
time duration.
@end itemize

Implementations are required to implement @utc{}, monotonic time, @cpu{}
time in current process, and time duration.  Implementations are allowed
to create extensions (for example, amount of time spent in garbage
collection).

A @emph{Time} object consists of three components:

@table @emph
@item Time type
A symbol representing the time system representation used.  The
constants @code{TIME-TAI}, @code{TIME-UTC}, @code{TIME-MONOTONIC},
@code{TIME-THREAD}, @code{TIME-PROCESS}, and @code{TIME-DURATION} must
be provided for these symbols.  Implementations should provide constants
for time type extensions.

@item Second
An integer representing the number of whole seconds from ``the epoch''.

@item Nanosecond
An integer of the number of nanoseconds in the fractional portion.
Although a time object has nanosecond precision, clocks may have a lower
resolution.
@end table

A @emph{Date} object, which is distinct from all existing types,
represents a point in time as represented by the Gregorian calendar as
well as by a time zone.  @emph{Date} objects are immutable.  A
@emph{Date} object consists of the following components:

@table @emph
@item Nanosecond
An integer between 0 and 9,999,999, inclusive.

@item Second
An integer 0 and 60, inclusive, (60 represents a leap second).

@item Minute
An integer between 0 and 59, inclusive.

@item Hour
An integer between 0 and 23, inclusive.

@item Day
An integer between 0 and 31, inclusive, the upper limit depending on the
month and year of the point in time.

@item Month
An integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; in which 1 means January, 2
February, and so on.

@item Year
An integer representing the year.

@item Time zone
A integer the number of seconds east of GMT for this timezone.
@end table

A @emph{Julian Day} represents a point in time as a real number of days
since -4714-11-24T12:00:00Z (November 24, -4714 at noon, @utc{}).

A @emph{Modified Julian Day} represents a point in time as a real number
of days since 1858-11-17T00:00:00Z (November 17, 1858 at midnight, UTC).

Current time, of type @var{time-type} system, which defaults to
@code{time-utc}.
@end defun

Return an exact integer representing the clock resolution, in
nanoseconds, of the system clock of type type @var{time-type} system,

@c page
@node srfi time spec timeobj compar
@appendixsubsubsec Time object comparison procedures


All of the time comparison procedures require the time objects to be of
the same type.  It is an error to use these procedures on time objects
of different types.  For the point--in--time measurements (e.g.
@code{time-tai} and @code{time-utc}), the semantics are described in
plain text.  For durations (e.g. @code{time-duration}, @code{time-cpu})
the semantics are described in parentheses.

The following procedures are required.


@defun time<=? @var{time1} @var{time2}
@true{} if @var{time1} is before or at (less than or equal to)
@var{time2}, @false{} otherwise.
@end defun


@defun time<? @var{time1} @var{time2}
@true{} if @var{time1} is before (less than) @var{time2}, @false{}
otherwise.
@end defun


@defun time=? @var{time1} @var{time2}
@true{} if @var{time1} at (equal) @var{time2}, @false{} otherwise.
@end defun


@defun time>=? @var{time1} @var{time2}
@true{} if @var{time1} is at or after (greater than or equal to)
@var{time2}, @false{} otherwise.
@end defun


@defun time>? @var{time1} @var{time2}
@true{} if @var{time1} is after (greater than) @var{time2}, @false{}
otherwise.
@end defun

@c page

@end defun


@defun time-difference! time1 time2 -> time-duration

@end defun

@appendixsubsubsec Date to string/string to date converters


The following procedures provide conversion to and from strings.  They
are required.  The specification below describes a ``locale''; the
specification of locales is beyond this @srfi{}.


@defun date->string @var{date} [@var{format-string}]
Converts a date to a string, using the format string.  The format string
is copied as is; except escape characters (indicated by the tilde) are
replaced with specfic conversions.  The following table lists the
required conversion specifiers; implementations are free to extend this
list.

@defun string->date @func{input-string} @func{template-string}
Converts an input string to a date, using the template string.  The

(1) move to the next character in the input string fulfilling a
criterion; (2) read a value, and (3) act on this value in some way. The
