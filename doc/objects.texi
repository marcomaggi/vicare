@chapter Built in Scheme objects


Built in Scheme objects are mostly implemented in the C language portion
of the source code, but many core operations are also reimplemented at
the Scheme level.  The overall definitions are in the C language file
@file{vicare.h} (for the public @api{}) the C language file
@file{internal.h} (for the private @api{}) and the definition of many
values is duplicated in the Scheme language compiler
@file{ikarus.compiler.sls}.

@section Built in object references


Values of type @ikptr{} at the C language level are the ones we move
around as arguments and return values at the Scheme level; they
represent machine words.  @ikptr{} values have two major
interpretations:

@table @strong
@item Immediate values
Objects that fit in a single machine word: special constants, fixnums,
characters and input/output port transcoders.

@item Reference values
Objects allocated on the heap and subject to garbage collection; they
are represented by tagged pointers: symbols, pairs, vectors,
bytevectors, structures, ports, bignums, ratnums, flonums, compnums,
cflonums, strings, closures, continuations, codes, pointers.
@end table

@noindent
immediate @ikptr{} values have two minor interpretations:

@table @strong
@item Immediate special constants
These are @true{}, @false{}, nil, void, unbound, @acronym{BWP}.

@item Immediate variable values
These are fixnums, characters and transcoders.
@end table

@noindent
reference @ikptr{} values have two minor interpretations:

@table @strong
@item Vector tagged references
Memory pointer values whose @math{3} least significant bits are set to
the vector tag.  They reference multiword objects allocated on the heap:
vectors, bignums, structures, flonums, ratnums, compnums, cflonums,
continuations, code, ports, symbols, pointers.

@item Specially tagged references
Pointer values whose @math{3} least significant bits are set to a
type--specific tag.  They reference multiword objects allocated on the
heap: pairs, bytevectors, closures, strings.
@end table


@deftp {Object Reference} ikptr
An immediate built in object or a reference to a built in object;
implemented as an @code{unsigned long int} it is meant to be the size of
a machine word.  The definition assumes that:

@itemize
@item
On 32-bit platforms, @code{unsigned long int} is a 32-bit value.

@item
On 64-bit platforms, @code{unsigned long int} is a 64-bit value.

@item
The type @code{unsigned long int} is big enough to hold a pointer for
the underlying platform.
@end itemize
@end deftp


@deftypefn {Preprocessor Macro} int IK_TAGOF (ikptr @var{ref})
Return an integer representing the @math{3} least significant bits of an
@ikptr{} value.
@end deftypefn


@deftypefn {Preprocessor Macro} ikptr IK_REF (ikptr @var{value_ref}, long @var{byte_offset})
@deftypefnx {Preprocessor Macro} ikptr ref (ikptr @var{value_ref}, long @var{byte_offset})
Getter and setter for machine words.  Interpret @var{value_ref} as a
pointer to an array of @ikptr{} values and locate the value at the
zero--based @var{byte_offset}.  A use of this macro can appear both as
operand and as left--side of an assignment.

@example
ikptr   P, Q;

Q = IK_REF(P, 2*wordsize); /* retrieve the 3rd word */
IK_REF(P, 0) = 123L;       /* store a value in the 1st word */
@end example

Both @var{value_ref} and @var{byte_offset} are first cast to @code{long}
values, then added and the sum is cast to @code{ikptr *}.

There are two categories of values for @var{byte_offset}: offsets and
displacements; both are usually precomputed at compile time and are
predefined for the built in Scheme values.

@table @dfn
@item Displacements
They are plain numbers of bytes to be added to an @strong{untagged}
pointer to obtain the memory address of a machine word.

@item Offsets
They are number of bytes from which a Scheme value's tag is subtracted:
adding an offset to a @strong{tagged} pointer removes the tag and
computes the memory address of a machine word, in a single step.
@end table

Given an @strong{untagged} pointer to a vector, the fixnum representing
the length of the vector can be obtained with:

@example
ikptr   p_vector = ...;
ikptr   s_length = IK_REF(p_vector, disp_vector_length);
@end example

@noindent
predefined displacements have names prefixed with @code{disp_}; given a
@strong{tagged} pointer to a vector, the fixnum representing the length
of the vector can be obtained with:

@example
ikptr   s_vector = ...;
ikptr   s_length = IK_REF(s_vector, off_vector_length);
@end example

@noindent
predefined offsets have names prefixed with @code{off_}.  An offset can
be computed from a displacement simply by subtracting the tag:

@example
off_vector_length = disp_vector_length - vector_tag
@end example

@noindent
this because we can build a tagged pointer from an untagged and aligned
one with:

@example
s_vector = p_vector | vector_tag = p_vector + vector_tag
@end example

@noindent
and vice versa we can compute an untagged pointer from a tagged one
with:

@example
p_vector = s_vector - vector_tag
@end example

@noindent
and so:

@example
s_vector + off_vector_length = p_vector + disp_vector_length
@end example

@quotation
@strong{NOTE} @cfunc{ref} is defined only in the internal header file
and its use is deprecated.
@end quotation
@end deftypefn

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Immediate values

All the immediate values but fixnums have the @math{3} least significant
bits set to @math{1}; to distinguish between immediate values and
references we can do:

@example
ikptr   X;

if (IK_IS_FIXNUM(X) || (immediate_tag == IK_TAGOF(X)))
  it_is_immediate();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

@noindent
where:

@example
immediate_tag = 7 = #b111
@end example


@defmac IK_FALSE_OBJECT 0x2F
@defmacx IK_FALSE
@defmacx IK_TRUE_OBJECT 0x3F
@defmacx IK_TRUE
@defmacx IK_NULL_OBJECT 0x4F
@defmacx IK_NULL
@defmacx IK_EOF_OBJECT 0x5F
@defmacx IK_EOF
@defmacx IK_VOID_OBJECT 0x7F
@defmacx IK_VOID
Special machine words of type @ikptr{} representing, respectively:
@false{}; @true{}; nil, the empty list; @eof{}, the end of file;
@void{}, the return value of functions returning no value.
@end defmac


@defmac IK_UNBOUND_OBJECT 0x6F
@defmacx IK_UNBOUND
Special machine word value stored in the @code{value} and @code{proc}
fields of Scheme symbol memory blocks to signal that these fields are
unset.
@end defmac


@defmac IK_BWP_OBJECT 0x8F
@defmacx IK_BWP
Special machine word value stored in locations that used to hold weak
references to values which have been already garbage collected.
@end defmac

The variable values that fit in a single machine word are fixnums,
characters and port transcoders.  The last byte of these machine words
is tagged as follows:

@example
   object      |  tag bits  | tag hex | mask bits
---------------+------------+---------+------------
fixnums 32-bit | #b??????00 |   --    | #b00000011
fixnums 64-bit | #b?????000 |   --    | #b00000111
characters     | #b00001111 |  #x0F   | #b11111111
transcoders    | #b01111111 |  #x7F   | #b11111111
@end example

@noindent
to identify a fixnum we can do:

@example
ikptr   X;

if (fx_tag == (X & fx_mask))
  it_is_a_fixnum();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

@noindent
or just use the macro @cfunc{IK_IS_FIXNUM}; similarly for for the other
immediate variable values.

Notice that a @cnull{} pointer stored in a @ikptr{} with zero bits as
tag represents the fixnum zero; also, the zero tag bits for fixnums are
in such a number that: a tagged @ikptr{} fixnum can be interpreted as
the number of bytes needed to hold a number of machine words equal to
the number represented by the fixnum itself, that is the following holds
true:

@example
long    number_of_words = ...;

number_of_words * wordsize == number_of_words << fx_shift;
@end example

@noindent
where @code{fx_shift} is the number of bits in the fixnum's tag.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Values allocated on the heap

The values that do not fit into a single machine word are composed of a
reference machine word and an array of machine words on the heap; they
are: symbols, pairs, vectors, bytevectors, structures, ports, bignums,
ratnums, flonums, compnums, cflonums, strings, closures, continuations,
codes, pointers.

The machine words used as reference have the @math{3} least significant
bits used as tag and the remaining most significant bits used to store a
pointer in memory; on 32-bit platforms the layout of such machine words
is:

@example
 PPPPPPPP PPPPPPPP PPPPPPPP PPPPPTTT   P = bit of pointer
|--------|--------|--------|--------|  T = bit of tag
  byte 3   byte 2   byte 1   byte 0
@end example

@noindent
the following tags are used:

@example
  object    | tag bits | tag hex | mask bits
------------+----------+---------+------------
pairs       |   #b001  |   #x1   | #b00000111
bytevectors |   #b010  |   #x2   | #b00000111
closure     |   #b011  |   #x3   | #b00000111
vectors     |   #b101  |   #x5   | #b00000111
strings     |   #b110  |   #x6   | #b00000111
@end example

@noindent
notice how @strong{none} of the tags for reference words is
@code{#b111}, which is reserved for immediate values; also notice how
@code{#b100} must @strong{not} be used as tag, because on 32-bit
platforms it would match the fixnums with the least significant bit set
to zero.

The vector tag is used to tag machine word references to multiple object
types: vectors, bignums, structures, flonums, ratnums, compnums,
cflonums, continuations, code, ports, symbols, pointers, system
continuations.  The first word in the memory block of these types has
the least significant bits set to a secondary tag.

All the possible values for @math{3}-bit tags in reference values are
already allocated; new object types can be added only by defining a new
secondary tag with references tagged as vector.

While the @api{} defines predicates to recognise values, to identify a
type--specific reference we can do:

@example
ikptr   X;

if (pair_tag == (X & pair_mask))
  it_is_a_pair();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

@noindent
similarly for the other types.  The vector tag acts as @dfn{primary
tag}; a @dfn{secondary tag} is stored in the least significant bits of
the referenced vector of words on the heap; to recognise such values we
can do:

@example
ikptr  X;

if ((vector_tag    == (X & vector_mask)) &&
    (secondary_tag == (secondary_mask & IK_REF(X, -vector_tag))))
  it_is();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

@noindent
where @code{secondary_tag} and @code{secondary_mask} are type--specific.
The secondary tags and the associated masks are:

@example
   object           |  tag bits   | tag hex | tag mask
                    |    76543210 |         |    76543210
--------------------+-------------+---------+-------------
vector              |  #b??????00 | fixnum  |    --
bignum              |  #b????s011 |   #x03  | #b00000111
structure           |  #b?????101 |   #x05  | #b00000111
flonum              |  #b00010111 |   #x17  |    --
ratnum              |  #b00100111 |   #x27  |    --
compnum             |  #b00110111 |   #x37  |    --
cflonum             |  #b01000111 |   #x47  |    --
continuation        |  #b00011111 |   #x1F  |    --
code                |  #b00101111 |   #x2F  |    --
port                |  #b??111111 |   #x3F  | #b00111111
symbol              |  #b01011111 |   #x5F  |    --
pointer             | #b100000111 |  #x107  |    --
system continuation | #b100011111 |  #x11F  |    --
@end example

@noindent
notice how the port secondary tag has all the @math{6} least significant
bits set to @math{1}: no other tag must have all such bits set to
@math{1}.  Secondary tags for new types can be allocated by selecting
the least significant byte to @code{#x0F} and reserving a specific bit
pattern in the most significant bytes.

The only tags having an associated mask are the ones of objects storing
additional informations in the first word of the heap vector:

@table @strong
@item Vectors
The first word of a vector is a fixnum representing the number of
elements.

@item Bignums
The first word uses the @math{3} least significant bits as tag, the
@math{4}th bit representing the sign (@math{0} for positive, @math{1}
for negative) and the remaining bits representing the number of words in
the bignum data area.

@item Structures
The first word is tagged as vector, because the first word of a
structure is itself a reference to a structure: the type descriptor.

@item Ports
The most significant bits of the first word are used for port
attributes.
@end table

@section Memory allocation and collection


In short, memory allocation which may trigger a garbage collection is
performed as follows:

@example
ikpcb *   pcb = ik_the_pcb();
long int  number_of_bytes = the_number_of_bytes;
ikptr     p = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, IK_ALIGN(number_of_bytes));
@end example

@noindent
while memory allocation without garbage collection is performed as
follows:

@example
ikpcb *   pcb = ik_the_pcb();
long int  number_of_bytes = the_number_of_bytes;
ikptr     p = ik_unsafe_alloc(pcb, IK_ALIGN(number_of_bytes));
@end example

@noindent
where @code{p} is an untagged memory pointer and @code{pcb} is a pointer
to the ``Process Control Block'' data structure.

To add a tag, for example the @code{vector_tag}, to an untagged memory
pointer we can do:

@example
ikpcb * pcb = ik_the_pcb();
long    len = IK_ALIGN(the_number_of_bytes);
ikptr   ref = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, len) | vector_tag;
@end example

Objects subject to garbage collection are allocated on the Scheme heap,
which is an array of contiguous memory segments; the next object is
allocated in the ``current segment'' of the heap:

@example
    allocated  allocated      allocated
    block      block          block
...|----------|--------------|--------|------...
    ^          ^              ^        ^
    |          |              |        |
  pointer    pointer        pointer   pointer to
                                      next block
@end example

@noindent
every pointer must satisfy alignment constraints with the following
purposes:

@enumerate
@item
To make pointer indirection efficient for the underlying platform.

@item
To have pointer values with the @math{3} least significant bits set to
zero, so that such bits can be used to hold an object's type tag.
@end enumerate

@noindent
for these reasons we must always filter the requested size (in bytes)
through the @cfunc{IK_ALIGN} macro.

The @pcb{} always references a ``pointer to the next free block'' with
alignment constraints satisfied; if we filter the requested number of
bytes through @cfunc{IK_ALIGN}, we obtain a number of bytes which, added
to the pointer, gives a correctly aligned pointer:

@example
uint8_t * allocated_block = (uint8_t *)pcb->allocation_pointer;
long      requested_size  = ...;
long      align_size      = IK_ALIGN(requested_size);
uint8_t * next_free_block = allocated_block + align_size;
pcb->allocation_pointer   = (ikptr)next_free_block;

/* use "allocated_block" */


            requested size
       |.......................|
            aligned size
       |..........................|
...----|--------------------------|-----------....
        ^                          ^
        |                          |
      pointer to an              pointer to the
      allocated block            next block
@end example


@deftypefun {ikpcb *} ik_the_pcb (void)
Return a pointer to the current process control block.  It is rarely
needed because when calling a C function from Scheme a pointer to the
@pcb{} is always pushed on the C stack as last argument.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefn {Preprocessor Macro} {unsigned long} IK_ALIGN (unsigned long @var{number_of_bytes})
Convert @var{number_of_bytes} to the number of bytes requested to
satisfy pointer alignment constraints.  The aligned size is always an
exact multiple of the underlying platform's word size (32-bit or
64-bit); precisely: it is the smallest multiple of the wordsize which is
greater than @var{number_of_bytes} and makes the pointer have the
@math{3} least significant bits set to zero.

This means that it is impossible to allocate less than @math{2} machine
words.
@ignore
We can simulate the computation with:

@example
(import (ikarus))

(define sizeof-ikptr
  (make-parameter #f))

(define (align n)
  (let* ((wordsize      (sizeof-ikptr))
         (wordshift     (if (= wordsize 4) 2 3))

         (align_size    (* 2 wordsize))
         (<<            bitwise-arithmetic-shift-left)
         (>>            bitwise-arithmetic-shift-right))
    (<< (>> (- (+ n align_size) 1)
            align_shift)
        align_shift)))

(define (print-align number-of-bytes)
  (let ((m              (align number-of-bytes))

@deftypefun ikptr ik_safe_alloc (ikpcb * @var{pcb}, unsigned long @var{align_size})
Allocate a memory block on the heap and return a reference to it as an
@strong{untagged} pointer.  @var{pcb} must reference the process control
block, @var{align_size} must be the requested number of bytes filtered
through @cfunc{IK_ALIGN}.

If not enough memory is available on the current heap segment: a garbage
collection is triggered; then allocation is tried again: if it still
fails the process is terminated with exit status @code{EXIT_FAILURE}.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun ikptr ik_unsafe_alloc (ikpcb * @var{pcb}, unsigned long @var{align_size})
Allocate a memory block on the Scheme heap and return a reference to it
as an @strong{untagged} pointer.  @var{pcb} must reference the process
control block, @var{align_size} must be the requested number of bytes
filtered through @cfunc{IK_ALIGN}.

If not enough memory is available on the current heap segment: a new
heap segment is allocated; if such allocation fails: the process is
terminated with exit status @code{EXIT_FAILURE}.

We notice explicitly that this function @strong{does not} trigger a
garbage collection run, so, when using it, it is not needed to register
C pointers as garbage collection roots.
@end deftypefun


@deffn {Preprocessor Macro} IK_ASS (ikptr @var{left}, ikptr @var{right})
Perform a C language assignment enforcing the order of evaluation of the
left--side and right--side expressions.  First evaluate @var{right},
then evaluate @var{left}, finally store the result of @var{right} in the
lvalue resulting from evaluating @var{left}.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Writing correct C language code

The garbage collector considers an object ``in use'' if at least one
reference to it is reachable from the roots of the garbage collection;
if an @ikptr{} reference exists only in a @acronym{CPU} register or on
the C language stack, or on the C language heap out of segments
allocated for Scheme: the garbage collector will not see it.  This
allows to avoid scanning the full process' stack for references to
values, but imposes care when writing C language code.

Whenever we call @cfunc{ik_safe_alloc} or a function relying on it for
memory allocation: a garbage collection may run and Scheme objects may
be moved from their location in memory to another memory segment; this
renders invalid all the pointers in the @acronym{CPU} registers, on the
C stack and the C heap.  Notice that this includes the arguments to C
functions called from Scheme through the macro @func{foreign-call}.

We must write C code with the following constraints:

@itemize
@item
Before a call to @cfunc{ik_safe_alloc}: we must make sure that all the
Scheme objects we are using in C code are reachable by the garbage
collector.  This is done by registering an object as garbage collector
root through the @code{root} fields of the @pcb{}.

@item
After a call to @cfunc{ik_safe_alloc}: we must reobtain all the pointers
to the internals of the objects we are using.
@end itemize

To help identification of C functions and macros allocating memory: the
ones calling @cfunc{ik_safe_alloc} are prefixed with @code{ika_} and
@code{IKA_}; the ones calling @cfunc{ik_unsafe_alloc} are prefixed with
@code{iku_} and @code{IKU_}.

Example of @strong{correct} code: @code{s_one} is protected while
allocating @code{s_two}:

@example
ikpcb * pcb = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_one, s_two;

s_one = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 10);
pcb->root0 = &s_one;
@{
  s_two = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 10); /* GOOD */
@}
pcb->root0 = NULL;
@end example

@noindent
example of @strong{wrong} code: after the second call to the allocation
function the value in @code{s_one} may be invalid:

@example
ikpcb * pcb = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_one, s_two;

s_one = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 10);
s_two = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 10);
/* do something with "s_one" and "s_two" */ /* WRONG */
@end example

Example of @strong{correct} code: @code{s_one} is protected while
allocating @code{s_two} and after the second allocation the pointer to
the data area of @code{s_one} is retrieved again:

@example
ikpcb * pcb = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_one;
ikptr   s_two;
char *  one;
char *  two;

s_one = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 10);
one   = IK_BYTEVECTOR_DATA_CHARP(s_one);
/* do something with "one" */
pcb->root0 = &s_one;
@{
  s_two = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 10);
@}
pcb->root0 = NULL;
one   = IK_BYTEVECTOR_DATA_CHARP(s_one); /* GOOD */
two   = IK_BYTEVECTOR_DATA_CHARP(s_two);
/* do something with "one" and "two" */
@end example

@noindent
example of @strong{wrong} code: after the second call to the allocation
function the pointer to the data area of @code{s_one} may be invalid:

@example
ikpcb * pcb = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_one;
ikptr   s_two;
char *  one;
char *  two;

s_one = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 10);
one   = IK_BYTEVECTOR_DATA_CHARP(s_one);
/* do something with "one" */
pcb->root0 = &s_one;
@{
  s_two = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 10);
@}
pcb->root0 = NULL;
two   = IK_BYTEVECTOR_DATA_CHARP(s_two);
/* do something with "one" and "two" */ /* WRONG */
@end example

Notice that, according to the C standard Section 6.5.16 ``Assignment
operators'': the order of evaluation of the operands is
unspecified@footnote{For an introduction to such problems see
@urldate{Jan 12, 2012}:

@center @url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point}
}.  In the following code:

@example
IK_CAR(s_pair) = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 8); /* WRONG */
@end example

@noindent
the left--side expression may be evaluated before the right--side one,
resulting in the value referenced by @code{s_pair} to be invalid when
the memory assigment actually takes place; so we have to code:

@example
ikptr   s_tmp;
s_tmp          = ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 8); /* GOOD */
IK_CAR(s_pair) = s_tmp;
@end example

@noindent
or:

@example
IK_ASS(IK_CAR(s_pair), ika_bytevector_alloc(pcb, 8)); /* GOOD */
@end example

@noindent
yes, it is a hard life.

Let's consider the following snippet, which is @strong{wrong}:

@example
ikpcb * pcb = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_one, s_two;

s_one = IKA_PAIR_ALLOC(pcb); /* WRONG */
pcb->root0 = &s_one;
@{
  s_two = IKA_PAIR_ALLOC(pcb);
@}
pcb->root0 = NULL;
@end example

@noindent
when the second pair is allocated, the first pair has car and cdr still
uninitialised: the content of these words is undefined; this may cause
undefined behaviour while the second allocation takes place and the
garbage collection tries to scan the first pair.  The @strong{correct}
code is:

@example
ikpcb * pcb = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_one, s_two;

s_one = ika_pair_alloc(pcb); /* GOOD */
pcb->root0 = &s_one;
@{
  s_two = IKA_PAIR_ALLOC(pcb);
@}
pcb->root0 = NULL;
@end example

@noindent
because @cfunc{ika_pair_alloc} initialises the car and the cdr.

@node objects fixnums
@section Fixnum objects


Fixnums are ``small'' exact integers which fit in a single machine word:
if the word size is @math{4}, @math{30} bits are used for fixnum
representation; else the word size is @math{8} and @math{61} bits are
used for fixnum representation.  On a 32-bit platform, @math{30} bits
are available to store the number:

@example
(greatest-fixnum)       @result{} +536870911
(expt 2 29)             @result{} +536870912
(- (expt 2 29) 1)       @result{} +536870911

(least-fixnum)          @result{} -536870912
(- (expt 2 29))         @result{} -536870912
@end example

@itemize
@item
With machine words 32-bit wide, which means the word size is @math{4}
bytes, the representation of a fixnum is:

@example
 30 bits fixnum representation
      |........................|00

      |-----|-----|-----|------+--|
       byte3 byte2 byte1   byte0
@end example

@noindent
the two least significant bits are set to zero: this ``tags'' the
machine words which embed fixnums.

@item
With machine words 64-bit wide, which means the word size is @math{8}
bytes, the representation of a fixnum is:

@example
         61 bits fixnum representation
|...............................................|000

|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----+---|
 byte7 byte6 byte5 byte4 byte3 byte2 byte1  byte0
@end example

@noindent
the three least significant bits are set to zero: this ``tags'' the
machine words which embed fixnums.
@end itemize

The fixnums tag is @code{00} on 32-bit platforms and @code{000} on
64-bit platforms; given the symbols:

@table @code
@item fx_shift
Set to the number of bits in the tag.

@item fx_scale
Set to the number of bytes in a machine word.
@end table

@noindent
the value is selected in such a way that:

@example
length_in_bytes = number_of_words *  fx_scale
                = number_of_words *  wordsize
                = number_of_words << fx_shift
@end example

@noindent
this allows us, for example, to take the fixnum representing the number
of items in a vector and consider it directly as size of the vector's
data area in bytes.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations


Given an exact integer stored in a @code{long} value with the right
amount of bits, we encode a fixnum as follows:

@example
long    the_value  = ...;
ikptr   the_fixnum = (ikptr)(the_value << fx_shift);
@end example

@noindent
and we decode it as follows:

@example
ikptr   the_fixnum = ...;
long    the_value  = (long)(the_fixnum >> fx_shift);
@end example

@noindent
to verify if a @code{ikptr} is a fixnum we do:

@example
ikptr   the_fixnum = ...;

if (fx_tag == ((long)the_fixnum & fx_mask))
  it_is_a_fixnum();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

@noindent
it is better to use the convenience macros described below.


@defmac fx_tag 0
The fixnums tag.
@end defmac


@defmac fx_shift
The number of bits in the fixnums tag.  It is the amount of bits we have
to left--shift a machine word to encode its value as fixnum.

@section Pair objects and lists


A pair is a fixed--length block of memory composed of two machine words;
the @math{3} least significant bits of an @ikptr{} reference to a pair
are the pair tag.

@example
|-------------------------|-------------| reference to pair
      heap pointer           pair tag

|-------------------|-------------------| pair memory block
    word 0 = car        word 1 = cdr

single @ikptr{} machine word, and it is defined by the preprocessor
symbol @code{IK_NULL_OBJECT}.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations

Pairs are allocated as follows, leaving the car and cdr uninitialised:

@end example

@noindent
the car and cdr of a pair are extracted as follows:

@example
ikptr   s_pair = ...;
ikptr   s_car, s_cdr;

s_car = IK_REF(s_pair, off_car);
s_cdr = IK_REF(s_pair, off_cdr);

ikptr   s_car  = ...;
ikptr   s_cdr  = ...;

IK_REF(s_pair, off_car) = s_car;

@subsubheading Pairs and lists code examples

The suggested general way to allocate and initialise a pair is as
follows:

@example
ikpcb * pcb    = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_pair = ika_pair_alloc(pcb);

pcb->root0 = &s_pair;
@{
  IK_ASS(IK_CAR(s_pair), allocate_and_build_the_car(pcb));
  IK_ASS(IK_CDR(s_pair), allocate_and_build_the_cdr(pcb));
@}
pcb->root0 = NULL;
@end example

@noindent
notice how we take care of allocating the new pair with a function that
initialises the component words and of registering the pair as garbage
collection root before calling the constructors for the car and cdr.

If the component words do not need memory allocation, for example
because they are fixnums or already existing objects, we can use the
faster code:

@example
ikpcb * pcb    = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_pair = IKA_PAIR_ALLOC(pcb);

IK_CAR(s_pair) = IK_FIX(123);
IK_CDR(s_pair) = IK_FIX(456);
@end example

Let's say we need to build a list of bytevectors from @asciiz{} strings
in the array @code{argv} and there are @code{argc} of them:

@example
ikpcb *  pcb  = ik_the_pcb();
char **  argv = ...;
long     argc = ...;
ikptr    s_list;

if (argc) @{
  ikptr  s_spine;
  long   i;

  s_list = s_spine = ika_pair_alloc(pcb);
  pcb->root0 = &s_list;
  pcb->root1 = &s_spine;
  @{
    for (i=0; i<argc;) @{
      IK_ASS(IK_CAR(s_spine),
             ika_bytevector_from_cstring(pcb, argv[i]));
      if (++i < argc) @{
        IK_ASS(IK_CDR(s_spine), ika_pair_alloc(pcb));
        s_spine = IK_CDR(s_spine);
      @} else @{
        IK_CDR(s_spine) = IK_NULL_OBJECT;
        break;
      @}
    @}
  @}
  pcb->root1 = NULL;
  pcb->root0 = NULL;
@} else
  s_list = IK_NULL_OBJECT;

/* make use of S_LIST */
@end example

@c page
@node objects bytevectors
@section Bytevector objects


Bytevectors are blocks of memory referenced by machine words tagged as
bytevectors.  The first word in the memory block is a fixnum
representing the number of bytes in the data area; a bytevector is
capable of holding at most a number of bytes equal to the return value
of @func{greatest-fixnum}.

When allocating a bytevector capable of holding @math{N} bytes, the
actual size of the allocated data area is @math{N+1}; the additional
last byte is not part of the data area and is perpetually set to zero.
All @value{PRJNAME}'s functions operating on bytevectors set to zero the
byte right after the last used one in the data area.  This last byte
allows every bytevector to be used as @asciiz{} string at the C language
level.

To allow for the same binary layout on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms,
the data area starts @math{8} bytes after the beginning; on a 32-bit
platform the layout is:

@example
  1st word   2nd word                       last byte
|----------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
   length     unused        data area      set to zero
@end example

@noindent
on a 64-bit platform the layout is:

@example
       1st word                             last byte
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
       length               data area      set to zero
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations

Bytevector objects are fully allocated on the heap and subject to
garbage collection; to perform the allocation we compute the whole size
of the bytevector data area, add to it room for meta data and finally
compute the aligned block size:

@example
ikpcb * pcb        = ik_the_pcb();
long    bv_len     = the_number_of_bytes;
long    block_size = disp_bytevector_data + bv_len + 1;
lont    align_size = IK_ALIGN(block_size);
ikptr   bv = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size) | bytevector_tag;
@end example

@cfunc{ik_safe_alloc} returns an @ikptr{} value representing the
aligned pointer, having the @math{3} least significant bits set to zero;
we add to it the bytevector tag (an integer value fitting in @math{3}
bits) which allows to recognise bytevectors among all the other built in
objects.

We have to explicitly store the bytevector length in the memory block as
a fixnum and set the last byte to zero, so usually a full allocation
looks like this:

@example
ikptr
ika_bytevector_alloc (ikpcb * pcb, long bv_len)
@{
  long   align_size;
  ikptr  s_bv;
  char * data;
  align_size = IK_ALIGN(disp_bytevector_data + bv_len + 1);
  s_bv       = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size)
               | bytevector_tag;
  IK_REF(s_bv, off_bytevector_length) = IK_FIX(bv_len);
  data = (char *)(long)(s_bv + off_bytevector_data);
  data[bv_len] = '\0';
  return s_bv;
@}
@end example

@noindent
to acquire the number of bytes we do:

@example
ikptr  s_bv = the_bytevector;
long   bv_len;

bv_len = IK_UNFIX(IK_REF(s_bv, off_bytevector_length));
@end example

@noindent
and to access the data area we do:

@example
ikptr      s_bv = the_bytevector;
uint8_t *  data_area;

data_area = (uint8_t *)(long)(s_bv + off_bytevector_data);
@end example


@defvr {Preprocessor Symbol} bytevector_tag

@node objects vectors
@section Vector objects


Vectors are variable length blocks of memory referenced by machine words
tagged as vectors.  The first machine word of a vector block contains a
fixnum representing the vector length; this means that the first word of
a vector is tagged as a fixnum.

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to vector
      heap pointer         vector tag

|------------------------|-------------| vector first word
     number of words       fixnum tag
@end example

After the length machine word comes the data area: an array of machine
words, one for each vector slot; slot indexes are zero--based.

@example
      0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| vector memory block
  ^ |...............................|
  |        slots = data area
length
fixnum
@end example

A vector is capable of holding at most a number of values equal to the
return value of @func{greatest-fixnum}.  The fixnum representing the
vector length, interpreted as raw signed integer, also represents the
number of bytes in the data area.

A fixnum representing the index of slot N, interpreted as raw signed
integer, also represents the offset in bytes of the firts byte of the
slot with respect the beginning of the data area.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations

Vector objects are allocated on the heap; to perform the allocation we
compute the whole size of the data area, add to it room for meta data
and finally compute the aligned block size:

@example
ikpcb * pcb            = ik_the_pcb();
long    length         = the_number_of_items;
long    requested_size = wordsize * length;
long    block_size     = disp_vector_data + requested_size;
long    align_size     = IK_ALIGN(block_size);
ikptr   vec = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size) | vector_tag;
@end example

@noindent
@cfunc{ik_safe_alloc} returns an @ikptr{} value representing the
aligned pointer, having the @math{3} least significant bits set to zero;
we add to it the vector tag (an integer value fitting in @math{3} bits)
which allows to recognise vectors among all the other built in objects.

We have to explicitly store the vector length in the memory block as a
fixnum, so usually a full allocation looks like this:

@example
ikptr
ika_vector_alloc (ikpcb * pcb, long number_of_items)
@{
  long  align_size;
  ikptr s_len;
  ikptr s_vec;
  s_len      = IK_FIX(number_of_items);
  align_size = IK_ALIGN(disp_vector_data + s_len);
  s_vec      = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size) | vector_tag;
  IK_REF(s_vec, off_vector_length) = s_len;
  return s_vec;
@}
@end example

@noindent
notice how we exploit the fact that the fixnum representing the number
of elements equals the number of bytes in the data area needed to hold
such elements.

The allocation operations described above leaves the data area
uninitialised: its content is undefined.  This is bad if the garbage
collector moves the newly built vector before the elements are
initialised to a correct Scheme value.  The following function resets
the data area to a vector of zero fixnums:

@example
ikptr
ikrt_vector_clean (ikptr s_vec)
@{
  ikptr	s_len = IK_VECTOR_LENGTH_FX(s_vec);
  memset((char*)(long)(s_vec + off_vector_data), 0, s_len);
  return s_vec;
@}
@end example

To fill a vector of @math{3} items with fixnums we should do:

@example
ikptr  s_vec = the_vector;
IK_REF(s_vec, off_vector_data + 0 * wordsize) = IK_FIX(10);
IK_REF(s_vec, off_vector_data + 1 * wordsize) = IK_FIX(20);
IK_REF(s_vec, off_vector_data + 2 * wordsize) = IK_FIX(30);
@end example

@noindent
to retrieve the item at index @math{2} we do:

@example
ikptr  s_vec  = the_vector;
ikptr  s_item = IK_REF(s_vec, off_vector_data + 2 * wordsize);
@end example

@noindent
and to retrieve the vector length:

@example
ikptr  s_vec  = the_vector;
ikptr  s_len  = IK_REF(s_vec, off_vector_length);
long   length = IK_UNFIX(s_len);
@end example

@c page
@node objects structs
@section Struct objects


A data structure is a variable--length block of memory referenced by
machine words tagged as vectors; the first machine word of a structure
is a reference to its structure type descriptor (@std{}), which is
itself a data structure; the subsequent words, if any, are the fields of
the structure.  A block of memory is a data structure if and only if: a
reference to it is tagged as vector and its first word is tagged as
vector.

@example
|----------------|----------| reference to structure
  heap pointer    vector tag

|----------------|----------| first word of structure
  heap pointer    vector tag    = reference to STD
                                = reference to structure
@end example

The whole memory block layout of a struct with @math{5} fields is as
follows:

@example
|-----|------|------|------|------|------|
  STD  field0 field1 field2 field3 field4
@end example

@noindent
fields are indexed starting at zero.

The type descriptor of the type descriptors is the return value of
@func{base-rtd} at the Scheme level and the structure referenced by the
field @code{base_rtd} in the process control block (@pcb{}).  Such base
type descriptor is built at @value{PRJNAME}'s startup.

The graph of references for a structure and its type descriptor is as
follows:

@example
      STD ref
     |-------|---------------| structure instance
         |
  ---<---
 |
 |    RTD ref
  -->|-------|---------------| struct type descriptor
         |
  ---<---
 |
 |    STD ref
 +-->|-------|---------------| base struct type descriptor
 |       |
  ---<---
@end example

@noindent
the struct type descriptor of the base struct type descriptor is the
base type descriptor itself.

About @rnrs{6} records and their types:

@itemize
@item
An @rnrs{6} record instance is a struct instance whose first word
references its @rnrs{6} record type descriptor (@rtd{}).

@item
An @rnrs{6} record type descriptor (@rtd{}) is a struct instance of type
@code{<rtd>}.

@item
An @rnrs{6} record constructor descriptor is a struct instance of type
@code{<rcd>}.
@end itemize

The graph of references for an @rnrs{6} record and its type descriptor
is as follows:

@example
     RTD ref
    |-------|---------------| R6RS record instance
        |
 ---<---
|
|    STD ref
 -->|-------|---------------| R6RS record type descriptor
        |                      = struct instance of type <rtd>
 ---<---
|
|    STD ref
+-->|-------|---------------| <rtd> struct type descriptor
        |
 ---<---
|
|    STD ref
+-->|-------|---------------| base struct type descriptor
|       |
 ---<---
@end example

A struct type descriptor (@std{}) is a fixed--length block of memory
composed of @math{6} machine words interpreted as follows:

@enumerate
@item
A reference to the base @std{}.

@item
A fixnum representing the number of machine words in the structure minus
@math{1}; this is the number of fields in the structure excluding the
reference to the @std{}.  This value is @math{5} in the base @std{}.

@item
Scheme symbol representing the name of this structure type.

@item
Scheme list of symbols representing the names of fields in structures of
this type.

@item
False or a reference to closure used to print to a Scheme port the
structures of this type.  This is the @dfn{printer} function.

@item
Scheme symbol used as unique identifier for this type.
@end enumerate

Type descriptors are best defined at the Scheme level using the
functions from the @library{vicare} library, @ref{iklib structs} for
details.  To instantiate a structure at the C language level we should
write a C function accepting the type descriptor as argument, and have
the Scheme code hand the descriptor to it.  For example, at the Scheme
level we do:

@example
(define-struct timeval
  (tv_sec tv_usec))

(define (gettimeofday)
  (foreign-call "ikrt_posix_gettimeofday"
                (type-descriptor timeval)))
@end example

@noindent
and at the C level we do:

@example
ikptr
ikrt_posix_gettimeofday (ikptr s_rtd, ikpcb * pcb)
@{
  /* build and return an instance of "timeval" */
@}
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations

Data structure objects are allocated on the heap; to perform the
allocation we compute the whole size of the structure:

@example
ikpcb * pcb        = ik_the_pcb();
long    num_of_fields = ...;
long    block_size = disp_record_data +
                     wordsize * num_of_fields;
long    align_size = IK_ALIGN(block_size);
ikptr   s_stru     = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size) | record_tag;
@end example

@noindent
@cfunc{ik_safe_alloc} returns an @ikptr{} value representing the aligned
pointer, having the @math{3} least significant bits set to zero; we add
to it the record tag (an integer value fitting in @math{3} bits) which
allows to recognise records among all the other built in objects.

We have to explicitly store a reference to the @rtd{} in the first
machine word of the structure, so a full allocation looks like this:

@example
ikptr
ika_struct_alloc (ikpcb * pcb, ikptr s_rtd)
@{
  long	num_of_fields;
  long  align_size;
  ikptr s_stru;
  num_of_fields = IK_UNFIX(IK_REF(s_rtd, off_rtd_length));
  align_size = IK_ALIGN(disp_record_data +
                        num_of_fields * wordsize);
  pcb->root9 = &s_rtd;
  @{
    s_ stru = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size) | record_tag;
  @}
  pcb->root9 = NULL;
  IK_REF(s_stru, off_record_rtd) = s_rtd;
  return s_stru;
@}
@end example

The allocation operation described above leaves the data area
uninitialised: its content is undefined.  This is bad if the garbage
collector moves the newly built record before the elements are
initialised to a correct Scheme value.

To recognise an @ikptr{} value as reference to a structure we do:

@example
ikptr   R = the_value;

if ((record_tag == (record_mask & R)) &&
    (record_tag == (record_mask & IK_REF(R, off_record_rtd))))
  it_is_a_structure();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

@noindent
structure fields are identified at the C level by a zero--based index;
to store a value in field @math{2} of a structure we do:

@example
ikptr  s_stru  = the_structure;
ikptr  s_field = the_field;

IK_REF(s_stru, off_record_data + 2 * wordsize) = the_field;
@end example

@noindent
and to retrieve a the value of field @math{2} we do:

@example
ikptr  s_stru  = the_structure;
ikptr  s_field;

s_field = IK_REF(s_stru, off_record_data + 2 * wordsize);
@end example


@defvr {Preprocessor Symbol} record_mask
@defvrx {Preprocessor Symbol} record_tag

@node objects chars
@section Character objects


A Scheme character has two representations:

@itemize
@item
As a standalone Scheme object, it is a machine word whose least
significant bits are set to the character tag and whose most significant
bits are set to the character's Unicode code point.

@item
When embedded in a Scheme string, it is a 32-bit value whose least
significant bits are set to the character tag and whose most significant
bits are set to the character's Unicode code point.
@end itemize

@noindent
the least significant 32 bits of the two representations are equal.
@ref{unicode} for details on Unicode.

Let's say that machine words are 32-bit values, which means the word
size is @math{4} bytes; then the representation of a character is:

@example
|    Unicode code point    | char tag

|--------|--------|--------|--------|
  byte3    byte2    byte1    byte0
@end example

@noindent
the least significant byte is set to @code{#x0F}: this ``tags'' the
machine words which embed characters.  On 64-bit machines, the layout
is:

@example
        Unused              |Unicode code point  |char tag
|...........................|....................|......|

|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
 byte7  byte6  byte5  byte4  byte3  byte2  byte1  byte0
@end example

At the Scheme level: standalone characters are moved around as @ikptr{}
values, but when characters are stored in a string the @ikptr{} value is
converted to a 32-bit integer of type @code{ikchar}.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations

Standalone characters are encoded into @ikptr{} values as follows:

@example
unsigned long   unicode_code_point = the_code_point;
ikptr           s_char;

s_char = (unicode_code_point << char_shift) | char_tag;
@end example

@noindent
decoded to @code{unsigned long} values as follows:

@example
ikptr           s_char = the_character;
unsigned long   unicode_code_point;

unicode_code_point = s_char >> char_shift;
@end example

@noindent
and identified as follows:

@example
ikptr   X = the_value;

if (char_tag == (char_mask & X))
  it_is_a_character();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

Characters from a Scheme string are decoded from @code{ikchar} to
@code{unsigned long} as follows:

@example
ikchar          ch = the_32bit_character;
unsigned long   unicode_code_point;

unicode_code_point = s_char >> char_shift;
@end example

@noindent
and encoded from @code{unsigned long} to @code{ikchar} as follows:

@example
unsigned long   unicode_code_point = the_code_point;
ikchar          ch;

ch = (ikchar)((unicode_code_point << char_shift) | char_tag);
@end example

@end defvr

a C language @code{long} into a machine word ready to be tagged as
Scheme character.

@node objects strings
@section String objects


Strings are variable--length blocks of memory referenced by machine
words tagged as strings; strings are @strong{not} stored in memory in
@utf{}-32 format.  The first word in the memory block is a fixnum
representing the number of characters in the data area; a string is
capable of holding at most a number of characters equal to the return
value of @func{greatest-fixnum}.

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to string
      heap pointer         string tag

|------------------------|-------------| string first word
     number of words       fixnum tag
@end example

All the remaining space in the memory block is filled with 32-bit
unsigned integers whose least significant bits are set to the character
tag and whose most significant bits are set to the character's Unicode
code point:

@example
 tag ch0 ch1 ch2 ch3 ch4 ch5 ch6 ch7
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| string memory block
@end example

Character indexes are zero--based.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations

String objects are allocated on the heap; to perform the allocation we
compute the whole size of the data area, add to it room for meta data
and finally compute the aligned block size:

@example
ikpcb * pcb            = ik_the_pcb();
long    length         = the_number_of_chars;
long    requested_size = sizeof(ikchar) * length;
long    block_size     = disp_string_data + requested_size;
long    align_size     = IK_ALIGN(block_size);
ikptr   str = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size) | string_tag;
@end example

@noindent
@cfunc{ik_safe_alloc} returns an @ikptr{} value representing the aligned
pointer, having the @math{3} least significant bits set to zero; we add
to it the string tag (an integer value fitting in @math{3} bits) which
allows to recognise strings among all the other built in objects.

We have to explicitly store the string length in the memory block as a
fixnum, so usually a full allocation looks like this:

@example
ikptr
ik_string_alloc (ikpcb * pcb, long number_of_chars)
@{
  long  align_size;
  ikptr str;
  align_size = IK_ALIGN(disp_string_data
                        + number_of_chars * sizeof(ikchar));
  str        = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size) | string_tag;
  IK_REF(str, off_string_length) = IK_FIX(number_of_chars);
  return str;
@}
@end example

To fill a string of @math{3} chars with characters we should do:

@example
ikptr     s_str = the_string;
ikchar *  ch    = (ikchar*)(s_str + off_string_data);

ch[0] = IK_CHAR32_FROM_INTEGER(10);
ch[1] = IK_CHAR32_FROM_INTEGER(20);
ch[2] = IK_CHAR32_FROM_INTEGER(30);
@end example

@noindent
to retrieve the character at index @math{2} we do:

@example
long      index  = 2;
ikptr     s_str  = the_string;
ikchar *  ch     = (ikchar*)(s_str + off_string_data);
ikptr     s_char = (ikptr)ch[index];
@end example

@noindent
and to retrieve the string length:

@example
ikptr  s_str    = the_string;
ikptr  s_length = IK_REF(s_str, off_string_length);
long   length   = IK_UNFIX(s_length);

@section Symbol objects


A symbol is a fixed length memory block referenced by machine words
tagged as vectors.  The first machine word of a symbol block is tagged
has symbol in its least significant bits and it has the most significant
bits set to zero.

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to symbol
      heap pointer         vector tag

|------------------------|-------------| symbol first word
   all set to zero         symbol tag
@end example

A symbol memory block is @math{6} words wide and contains references to
objects begin the following fields: @code{string}, @code{ustring},
@code{value}, @code{proc}, @code{plist}.

The @code{value} field has multiple purposes:

@itemize
@item
When the symbol is the unique identifier of a data structure type: the
@code{value} field holds the @rtd{} of the data structure.

@item
Top level bindings in compiled Scheme code are represented by gensyms;
the value of a top level binding is stored in the @code{value} field of
a gensym memory block.
@end itemize

@node objects bignums
@section Bignum objects


Bignums are multi--precision exact integers bigger than fixnums; they
are implemented using the @code{mpn} @api{} of @gnu{} @gmp{},
@xref{Low-level Functions, mpn, Low-level Functions, gmp}.

@value{PRJNAME} only uses a bignum to represent an exact integer when
the value does not fit in a fixnum; it follows that the following ranges
are enforced:

@example
negative bignums < (least-fixnum) <= all fixnums

all fixnums <= (greatest-fixnum) < positive bignums
@end example

@noindent
and notice that:

@itemize
@item
The smallest positive bignum is @code{(+ 1 (greatest-fixnum))} which can
also be computed as @code{(- (least-fixnum))}.

@item
The greatest negative bignum is @code{(- (least-fixnum) 1)}.
@end itemize

A bignum is a variable length memory block referenced by machine words
tagged as vectors.  The first machine word of a bignum block is tagged
has bignum in its least significant bits; then comes a sign bit, zero if
positive; the remaining most significant bits represent the number of
words in the memory block after the first one.

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to bignum
      heap pointer         vector tag

                     sign bit
|----------------------|-|-------------| bignum first word
   number of words         bignum tag
@end example

A pointer to the second machine word in a bignum memory block is the
pointer of type @code{mp_limb_t} accepted by the @code{mpn_} functions
of @gmp{}; @dfn{limb}, in @gmp{} jargon, is a machine word holding a
portion of multi--precision number.  The layout of a bignum memory block
is as follows:

@example
|----|-----|-----|-----|-----| ...
 1st  limb0 limb1 limb2 limb3
@end example

@noindent
where the first word @code{1st} is header of meta informations encoded
as explained above and each limb is a machine word stored in
@strong{native} endianness; the big number is the concatenation of limbs
with @code{limb0} being the least significant one.  There is always at
least one limb; when a bignum is composed of a single limb, its value is
always non--zero and outside the range of fixnums.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations


To allocate a bignum we must know the number of required limbs:

@example
ikpcb * pcb        = ik_the_pcb();
long    nlimbs     = the_number_of_limbs;
long    block_size = disp_bignum_data + nlimbs * wordsize;
long    align_size = IK_ALIGN(block_size);
ikptr s_bn = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, align_size) | vector_tag;
@end example

@noindent
we must explicitly build and encode the first word; the number of limbs
is encoded as follows:

@example
long   nlimbs      = the_number_of_limbs;
ikptr  meta_nlimbs = nlimbs << bignum_nlimbs_shift;
@end example

@noindent
the sign bit is encoded as follows:

@example
long   sign      = zero_if_positive_one_if_negative;
ikptr  meta_sign = sign << bignum_sign_shift;
@end example

@noindent
and the full first word is composed and stored as follows:

@example
ikptr  s_bn        = the_bignum;
ikptr  meta_nlimbs = ...;
ikptr  meta_sign   = ...;
ikptr  s_fst       = meta_nlimbs | meta_sign | bignum_tag;

IK_REF(s_bn, off_bignum_tag) = s_fst;
@end example

To identify an object as bignum we do:

@example
ikptr  X = the_object;

if ((vector_tag == IK_TAGOF(X)) &&
    (bignum_tag == (bignum_mask & IK_REF(X, -vector_tag))))
  it_is_a_bignum();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

@noindent
to extract meta informations we must first extract the first word:

@example
ikptr   s_bn  = the_bignum;
ikptr   s_fst = IK_REF(s_bn, off_bignum_tag);
long    nlimbs;
long    meta_sign;

nlimbs    = ((ik_ulong)s_fst) >> bignum_nlimbs_shift;
meta_sign = ((ik_ulong)s_fst) &  bignum_sign_mask;
@end example

@noindent
if @code{meta_sign} is zero the bignum is positive, else it is negative.

To acquire a pointer to the data area we do:

@example
ikptr        s_bn = the_bignum;
mp_limb_t *  data;

data = (mp_limb_t*)(long)(s_bn + off_bignum_data);
@end example

@noindent
to extract the @math{N}-th limb we do:

@example
ikptr      s_bn = the_bignum;
long       N    = the_index;
mp_limb_t  limb;

limb = (mp_limb_t)IK_REF(s_bn, off_bignum_data + N * wordsize);
@end example

@section Ratnum objects


Ratnums are exact rational numbers, having a fixnum or bignum as
numerator and a fixnum or bignum as denominator; the numerator is always
non--zero; the denominator is always strictly positive, the sign of a
ratnum is the sign of the numerator.

A ratnum is a fixed length memory block referenced by machine words
tagged as vectors.  The first machine word of a ratnum block is tagged
has ratnum in its least significant bits and it has the most significant
bits set to zero.

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to ratnum
      heap pointer         vector tag

|------------------------|-------------| ratnum first word
   all set to zero         ratnum tag
@end example

A ratnum memory block is @math{4} words wide; a reference to the
numerator is stored in the second word and a reference to the
denominator is stored in the third word:

@example
   1st word     2nd word     3rd word     4th word
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
 tagged word   numerator   denominator     unused
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations


Ratnums are allocated on the Scheme heap as follows:

@example
ikpcb * pcb   = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_rn;

s_rn = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, ratnum_size) | vector_tag;
IK_REF(s_rn, off_ratnum_tag) = ratnum_tag;
@end example

@noindent
after allocation we must always initialise the numerator and denominator
fields to some correct value before running the next garbage collection;
a full allocation and initialisation is as follows:

@example
ikpcb * pcb   = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_num = the_numerator;
ikptr   s_den = the_denominator;
ikptr   s_rn;

pcb->root9 = &s_num;
pcb->root8 = &s_den;
@{
  s_rn = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, ratnum_size) | vector_tag;
@}
pcb->root8 = NULL;
pcb->root9 = NULL;

IK_REF(s_rn, off_ratnum_tag) = ratnum_tag;
IK_REF(s_rn, off_ratnum_num) = s_num;
IK_REF(s_rn, off_ratnum_den) = s_den;
@end example

To identify an object as ratnum we do:

@example
ikptr  X = the_object;

if ((vector_tag == IK_TAGOF(X)) &&
    (ratnum_tag == IK_REF(X, -vector_tag)))
  it_is_a_ratnum();
else
  it_is_not();
@end example

@noindent
to set or retrieve the numerator and denominator we do:

@example
ikptr  s_rn = the_ratnum;
ikptr  s_num;
ikptr  s_den;

s_num = IK_REF(s_rn, off_ratnum_num);
s_den = IK_REF(s_rn, off_ratnum_den);
IK_REF(s_rn, off_ratnum_num) = s_num;

@node objects flonums
@section Flonum objects


Flonums are double--precision floating point numbers (@math{8} bytes
wide) implemented as specified by @ieee{} 754 on the hosting platform.
A flonum is a fixed length memory block referenced by machine words
tagged as vectors.  The first machine word of a flonum block is tagged
has flonum in its least significant bits and it has the most significant
bits set to zero.

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to flonum
      heap pointer         vector tag

|------------------------|-------------| flonum first word
   all set to zero         flonum tag
@end example

A flonum memory block is @math{16} bytes wide on both 32-bit and 64-bit
platforms; to allow for the same binary layout on both platforms, on a
32-bit platform the actual number is stored in the last two words:

@example
   1st word     2nd word     3rd word     4th word
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
 tagged word     unused           data words
                          |.........................|
                                    flonum
@end example

@noindent
on a 64-bit platform the actual number is stored in the second word:

@example
          1st word                 2nd word
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
         tagged word               data word
                          |.........................|
                                    flonum
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations

Flonums are allcated on the heap as follows:

@example
ikpcb * pcb  = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_fl;

s_fl = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, flonum_size) | vector_tag;
IK_REF(s_fl, off_flonum_tag) = (ikptr)flonum_tag
@end example

@noindent
to identify an object as flonum we do:

@example
ikptr  X = the_object;

    (flonum_tag == IK_REF(X, -vector_tag)))
  it_is_a_flonum();

@node objects compnums
@section Compnum objects


Compnums are complex numbers having a fixnum, bignum, ratnum or flonum
as real part and a fixnum, bignum, ratnum or flonum as imaginary part,
but @strong{not} both flonums.  The imaginary part of a compnum object
is never the exact zero.

A compnum is a fixed length memory block referenced by machine words
tagged as vectors.  The first machine word of a compnum block is tagged
has compnum in its least significant bits and it has the most
significant bits set to zero.

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to compnum
      heap pointer         vector tag

|------------------------|-------------| compnum first word
   all set to zero         compnum tag
@end example

A compnum memory block is @math{4} words wide; a reference to the real
part is stored in the second word and a reference to the imaginary part
is stored in the third word

@example
   1st word     2nd word     3rd word     4th word
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
 tagged word   real part    imag part     unused
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations


Compnums are allocated on the Scheme heap as follows:

@example

ikptr   s_cn;

s_cn = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, compnum_size) | vector_tag;
IK_REF(s_cn, off_compnum_tag) = compnum_tag;
@end example

@noindent
after allocation we must always initialise the real and imaginary parts
to some correct value before running the next garbage collection; a full
allocation and initialisation is as follows:

@example
ikpcb * pcb  = ik_the_pcb();
ikptr   s_re = the_real;
ikptr   s_im = the_imag;
ikptr   s_cn;

pcb->root9 = &s_re;

IK_REF(s_cn, off_compnum_real) = s_re;
IK_REF(s_cn, off_compnum_imag) = s_im;
@end example

To identify an object as compnum we do:

@example

@end example

@noindent
if the requested memory is less than the exact multiple of a page size,
the last allocated bytes are unused and set to zero at allocation time.

The first machine word of a code memory block is tagged has code in its
least significant bits and it has the most significant bits set to zero.

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to code

@subsubheading Meta data in a code memory block

The first words of a code memory block hold meta data:

@enumerate
@item
The first word contains the secondary tag needed to recognise a Scheme
object as code object.

@item
The second word contains a non--negative fixnum representing the number
of used bytes in the allocated block; this is @strong{not} the number of
allocated bytes (multiple of the page size), just the number of bytes
actually used by meta data and binary code.

@item
The third word contains the reference to a Scheme vector used as
relocation vector.

@item
The fourth word contains a non--negative fixnum representing the number
of free variables in the contained code.  If such values is zero: the
code is a thunk.

@item
The fifth word contains a code annotation; it is initialised to
@false{}.

@item
The sixth word is currently unused; it is initialised to the fixnum
zero.
@end enumerate

@noindent
the subsequent words in the memory block are the code object's data
area.

@c page
@node objects codes reloc
@subsection The relocation vector


The @dfn{relocation vector} is a Scheme vector referenced by the meta
data of a code object; the relocation vector can be empty.

The relocation vector is divided into records, each some words long:

@example
   0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----| relocation vector
|...........|.................|.................|
 1st record      2nd record        3rd record
@end example

@noindent
the first word in each record contains a fixnum which must be
interpreted as bit field; such fixnum must never be zero.  On 32-bit
platforms the layout of such fixnum is:

@example
     bit7 bit6 bit5 bit4 bit3 bit2 bit1 bit0
... |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
........................|.........|.........| 1st record word
 number of bytes        record tag fixnum tag
@end example

@noindent
on 64-bit platforms the layout of such fixnum is:

@example
        bit7 bit6 bit5 bit4 bit3 bit2 bit1 bit0
   ... |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
......................|.........|..............| 1st record word
 number of bytes      record tag   fixnum tag
@end example

@noindent
the @math{2} least significant bits of the fixnum's data represent a
type tag for the record; the remaining most significant bits of the
fixnum's data area represent a number of bytes: a displacement in the
data area of the code object selecting the target word.

Whenever a code object is serialised into a @fasl{} file: the relocation
vector is appended to it in the @fasl{} file.  Whenever the garbage
collector moves a code object into a new location: the relocation vector
must be processed again to update the addresses.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Records of type: vanilla object

Such records are composed by @math{2} words: the first word contains the
tag and the displacement in bytes of the target word in the data area;
the second word contains the reference to the Scheme object (or the
Scheme object itself, if immediate).

When these records are processed: the object reference is stored into
the target word.

@example
   meta data         data area
  |.........|..........................|

s_code   p_data
  v         v
  |---------|--------------|----|------| code object
            |..............|....|target word
      ------->displacement   ^
     |                       |
     |     ------------------
     |    |
  |----|----| vanilla object record
   1st  2nd
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Records of type: displaced object

Such records are composed by @math{3} words: the first word contains the
tag and the displacement in bytes of the target word in the data area;
the second word contains a fixnum representing a byte offset; the third
word contains the reference to the Scheme object (or the Scheme object
itself, if immediate).

When these records are processed: the object reference is added to the
offset in bytes and the result is stored into the target word.

@example
   meta data         data area
  |.........|..........................|

s_code   p_data
  v         v
  |---------|--------------|----|------| code object
            |..............|....|target word
      ------->displacement   ^
     |                       |
     |       ----------------
     |      |
     |  off + obj
  |----|----|----| vanilla object record
   1st  2nd  3rd
@end example

Examples of displaced objects are: Scheme symbols referenced in the
code.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Records of type: jump label

Such records are composed by @math{2} words: the first word contains the
tag and the displacement in bytes of the target word in the data area;
@dots{}

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Records of type: foreign address

Such records are composed by @math{2} words: the first word contains the
tag and the displacement in bytes of the target word in the data area;
the second word contains the reference to a bytevector object holding
the C string representation of a foreign object name, in the format
suitable to be handed to @cfunc{dlsym}.

When these records are processed: @cfunc{dlsym} is used to retrieve the
address of the foreign object (which must be present in the global
namespace), then the address is stored directly in the target word.

@example
   meta data         data area
  |.........|..........................|

s_code   p_data
  v         v
  |---------|--------------|----|------| code object
            |..............|....|target word
      ------->displacement   ^
     |                       |
     |     --- dlsym() ------
     |    |
     |    |
  |----|----| vanilla object record
   1st  2nd
@end example

Examples of foreign objects are: the C functions exported by the runtime
program @command{vicare} to be called from Scheme; the C functions
exported by the shared library when using an extension to Vicare with
the model proposed by the Vicare/Template project (for example
Vicare/SQLite).

@c page
@node objects codes gc
@subsection Memory and garbage collection


Code objects are @strong{not} allocated on the heap like other common
objects (pairs, vectors, @dots{}); rather they are allocated in
specially memory mapped regions which receive execution protection.

Whenever the garbage collector encounters a reference to a code object:
it moves the code object itself into a new location to reduce
fragmentation.

@c page
@node objects closures
@section Closure objects


Closure objects are actual procedures: closure objects are the ones for
which the @func{procedure?} predicate returns @true{}.  A closure object
is a fixed length memory block referenced by machine words tagged as
closures; each closure object is associated to a code object that
implements the procedure.  The memory layout of a closure object is as
follows:

@example
|------------------------|-------------| reference to closure
      heap pointer         closure tag

                       0   1   2   3   4   5
|--------------------|---|---|---|---|---|---| memory block
  raw memory pointer    one slot for every
  to binary code        free variable
@end example

@noindent
the first word in the memory block holds a raw memory pointer
referencing the first byte in the code object implementing the closure;
the subsequent words (if any) are slots associated to the free variables
referenced by the closure's code.

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Inspecting a closure's free variables


We can take a look at the free variables referenced by a closure with
the facilities of the library @library{ikarus system $codes}.  In a
normal application: we must @strong{not} mess with the internals of
closure and code objects.

We start by noticing that in the following example: the function
@func{f} has no ``true'' free variables, because it accesses only global
variables:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs)
  (ikarus system $codes))
(define a 123)
(define (f)
  a)
($code-freevars ($closure-code f))      @result{} 0
@end example

In the following example: the function @func{f} is the only one
referencing the free variable @code{a}, so such variable is stored
directly in the closure's slot:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs)
  (ikarus system $codes))
(define f
  (let ((a 123))
    (lambda () a)))
($code-freevars ($closure-code f))      @result{} 1
($cpref f 0)                            @result{} 123
@end example

@noindent
when there are two such variables:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (vicare)
  (ikarus system $codes))

(define f
  (let ((a 123)
        (b 456))
    (lambda ()
      (list a b))))
($code-freevars ($closure-code f))      @result{} 2
($cpref f 0)                            @result{} 456
($cpref f 1)                            @result{} 123
@end example

When more than one closure references the same free variable, the
storage of the variable is inside a Scheme vector and such vector is
referenced by the slots of the closures:

@example
#!r6rs
(import (rnrs)
  (ikarus system $codes))
(define f #f)
(define g #f)
(let ((a 123))
  (set! f (lambda () a))
  (set! g (lambda (x)
            (set! a x)
            a)))
($code-freevars ($closure-code f))      @result{} 1
($cpref f 0)                            @result{} #(123)
($code-freevars ($closure-code g))      @result{} 1
($cpref g 0)                            @result{} #(123)
@end example

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Basic operations

Closure objects are allocated on the heap; to perform the allocation and
initialisation we do:

@example
ikptr   p_closure;
ikptr   s_closure;
ikptr   s_code = ...;

p_closure = ik_safe_alloc(pcb, IK_ALIGN(disp_closure_data));
s_closure = p_closure | closure_tag;
IK_REF(s_closure, off_closure_code) = s_code + off_code_data;
@end example

@noindent
@cfunc{ik_safe_alloc} returns an @ikptr{} value representing the aligned
pointer, having the @math{3} least significant bits set to zero; we add
to it the closure tag (an integer value fitting in @math{3} bits) which
allows to recognise closures among all the other built in objects.


@defvr {Preprocessor Symbol} closure_tag
An integer used to tag @ikptr{} references to closure memory blocks.
@end defvr


@defvr {Preprocessor Symbol} closure_mask
An integer representing the bitmask used to extract (with a bitwise
logic AND) the tag from @ikptr{} references to closure objects.
@end defvr


@defvr {Preprocessor Symbol} disp_closure_code
Displacement of code pointer.  The number of bytes to add to an
@strong{untagged} pointer to closure to get the pointer to the first
byte in the word of the closure's data area.
@end defvr


@defvr {Preprocessor Symbol} disp_closure_data
Number of bytes needed to hold a closure's memory block.  An integer to
add to an @strong{untagged} pointer to closure to obtain a pointer to
the first byte after the closure's memory block.
@end defvr


@defvr {Preprocessor Symbol} off_closure_code
An integer to add to a tagged @ikptr{} reference to retrieve the pointer
to the first byte of the word in the closure's data area.
@end defvr


@defvr {Preprocessor Symbol} off_closure_data
An integer to add to a tagged @ikptr{} vector reference to obtain a
pointer to the first byte after the closure's memory block.
@end defvr

@c ------------------------------------------------------------

@subsubheading Convenience preprocessor macros


@deftypefn {Preprocessor Macro} int IK_IS_CLOSURE (ikptr @var{X})
Evaluate to true if @var{X} is a reference to closure object.
@end deftypefn

@c page
@node objects continuations
@section Continuation objects


Continuation objects are memory blocks referenced by machine words
tagged as vectors, whose first word is tagged as continuation:

@example
|----------------|----------| reference to continuation
  heap pointer    vector tag

|----------------|----------| first word of continuation
 all set to zero  continuation tag
@end example

@noindent
the layout of a continuation memory block is:

@example
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
  tag   top  size  next
@end example

To understand the contents of a continuation object, we have to recall
how the Scheme stack is used:

@example
 high memory
|            |
|------------|
|            | <-- pcb->frame_base
|------------|
| used word  | <-- pcb->frame_base - wordsize
|------------|
|     .      |
|     .      |
|     .      |
|------------|
| free word  | <-- pcb->frame_pointer
|------------|
|     .      |
|     .      |
|     .      |
|------------|
| free word  | <-- pcb->stack_base
|------------|
|            |
  low memory
@end example

@noindent
and remember that @code{pcb->frame_base} references a word that is
one--off the end of the stack segment; so the first word in the stack
is:

@example
pcb->frame_base - wordsize
@end example

@noindent
A continuation references the portion of the Scheme stack memory segment
between @code{frame_base} and @code{frame_pointer}.

There are two kinds of continuation objects:

@table @dfn
@item Scheme continuations
Represent a Scheme continuation.  They are expliticly created by
@func{call/cc}, but also used to represent a previous Scheme code
execution when the allocated Scheme stack runs out of space.

@item system continuations
Represent a C continuation.  They are used by the @ffi{} to save the C
execution context just before calling back to Scheme from C code.
@end table

The fields of a Scheme continuation are:

@table @code
@item top
Untagged pointer referencing the first free word on the Scheme stack.

@item size
Number of bytes used on the Scheme stack, @strong{not} counting the free
word referenced by the frame pointer.

@item next
Tagged pointer referencing a continuation object; it represents the
continuation to go back to after the execution of tthis continuation is
finished.  This ``going back'' is performed by the C function
@cfunc{ik_exec_code}.
@end table

The fields of a Scheme continuation are:

@table @code
@item top
Untagged memory pointer referencing the C language stack last saved by
Scheme code; it is the content of the field @code{pcb->system_stack} at
the time this system continuation object was created.

@item size
Unused.

@item next
Tagged memory pointer referencing the next continuation; it is the
content of the field @code{pcb->next_k} at the time this system
continuation object was created.
@end table

Whatever the kind, usually a continuation is created and then saved in
the field @code{pcb->next_k} in such a way that continuation objects
create a linked list:

@example
        next_k
|------|------|-----| PCB
          |
          v     next
       |-------|----| continuation
                  |
                  v     next
               |-------|----| continuation
                          |
                           --> NULL
@end example

   | vector_tag;

IK_REF(s_kont, off_continuation_size) = \
   pcb->frame_base - pcb->frame_pointer - wordsize;
IK_REF(s_kont, off_continuation_next) = pcb->next_k;
pcb->next_k = s_kont;

@subsection Generalised C buffers


When interfacing a C language foreign library with @value{PRJNAME}, it
is often needed to convert Scheme objects to raw memory blocks, possibly
containing @asciiz{} strings.  Generalised C buffers are meant to be
used in interfaces to foreign C language libraries, when a pointer to
raw data is required as argument.  @ref{cbuffers buffers} for details.

Notice that at the C language level only general C buffers exist: Scheme
strings should be converted to bytevectors at the Scheme level.


@deftypefun size_t ik_generalised_c_buffer_len (ikptr @var{buffer}, ikptr @var{buffer_len})
Return the number of bytes in a generalised C buffer object.

@var{buffer} must be a bytevector, pointer object or @code{memory-block}
struct instance.

When @var{buffer} is a pointer object: @var{buffer_len} must be an exact
integer (in the range of the C language type @code{size_t}) representing
the number of bytes available in the referenced memory block.  Otherwise
@var{buffer_len} is ignored.

@deftypefn {Preprocessor Macro} {void *} IK_GENERALISED_C_BUFFER (ikptr @var{obj})

Given a bytevector object or a pointer object or a @code{memory-block}
object return a @code{void *} pointer referencing the data.  The second
macro accepts also @false{} as value and returns @cnull{}.

@deftypefun ikptr ikrt_general_copy (ikptr @var{dst}, ikptr @var{dst_start}, ikptr @var{src}, ikptr @var{src_start}, ikptr @var{count})
Copy @var{count} items from @var{src} starting at offset
@var{src_start}, to @var{dst} starting at offset @var{dst_start};
@var{src_start}, @var{dst_start} and @var{count} must be non--negative
fixnums.  Return unspecified values.

Both @var{dst} and @var{src} can be one among: a bytevector, a pointer,
a string.  For bytevectors and pointers: bytes are moved and
@var{src_start}, @var{dst_start} and @var{count} are in byte units.  For
strings: 32-bit values representing Unicode code points are moved and
@var{src_start}, @var{dst_start} and @var{count} are in character units.

@section Notes on calling Scheme code from C


While writing C language code interfacing with Scheme, if we call a C
language function which calls back a Scheme function we have to save and
restore the continuation:

@example
ikpcb * pcb = the_pcb;
ikptr   sk;

sk = ik_enter_c_function(pcb);
@{
  /* place here C code that calls Scheme code */
@}
ik_leave_c_function(pcb, sk);
@end example

@noindent
else, upon returning from the Scheme code, the execution flow will go to
the wrong continuation and undefined behaviour ensues.


@deftypefun ikptr ik_enter_c_function (ikpcb * @var{pcb})
Save the current Scheme continuation and return a reference to it.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun ikptr ik_leave_c_function (ikpcb * @var{pcb}, ikptr @var{sk})
Restore the previously saved Scheme continuation @var{sk}.
@end deftypefun
