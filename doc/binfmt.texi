@appendix Launching programs directly


This appendix describes an optional feature of that activates Scheme
programs execution through the mechanism of the @code{binfmt_misc} Linux
kernel module; it is available only on Unix--like platforms running the
Linux kernel.

By default the installation of the required files is disabled; to enable
it: at configuration time we must pass the @option{--enable-binfmt}
option to the @command{configure} script.

The mechanism allows to run Scheme programs without explicitly invoking
the executable runtime program.  It is a generalisation of the mechanism
that runs shell scripts whose file begins with @code{#!/bin/sh}.

@cindex Binary executables, kernel support

This kernel feature allows us to invoke almost every program by simply
typing its name in the shell.  This includes for example compiled Java,
Python or Emacs programs, and of course Scheme programs.

The feature is implemented in the @code{binfmt_misc} kernel module; it
recognises the binary file type by matching some bytes at the beginning
of the file with a magic byte sequence (masking out specified bits) we
have supplied; it can also recognise a filename extension.


@c page
@node binfmt loading
@appendixsec Loading the module


If the module is installed on the system, we will find it in:

@example
/lib/modules/<version>/kernel/fs/binfmt_misc.ko
@end example

@noindent
and to load it we do (as root):

@example
/sbin/modprobe binfmt_misc
@end example

@noindent
for example on a Slackware Linux installation, loading can be done by
uncommenting the relevant line in @file{/etc/rc.d/rc.modules}.

Then we add the following line to @file{/etc/fstab}:

@example
none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc defaults 0 0
@end example

@noindent
so that the @code{binfmt_misc} directory can be mounted and will be
mounted when booting the system.  We can freely mount and unmount this
virtual file system with (as root):

@example
$ mount  /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
$ umount /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
@end example

@noindent
but this is rarely useful.  There are other means of enabling and
disabling the feature.

@c page
@node binfmt registry
@appendixsec The registry


To actually register a new binary type, we have to set up a string like:

@example
:name:type:offset:magic:mask:interpreter:
@end example

@noindent
and echo it to @file{/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register}.  We can choose
the @code{:} character upon our needs and we can omit a field by simply
using an empty string; for example if we omit the offset and the mask
fields:

@example
:name:type::magic::interpreter:
@end example

Fields description follows.

@table @code
@item name
It is an identifier string.  A new @file{/proc} file will be created
with this name under @file{/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc}, and we can use it
to query and reset the configuration status.

@item type
It is the type of file recognition.  If set to @code{M} activates first
bytes recognition (also known as ``magic'' recognition); if set to
@code{E} activates file name extension recognition.

@item offset
It is the zero--based offset of the magic/mask in the file, counted in
bytes.  It is used only with magic recognition.  It defaults to zero.

@item magic
It is the byte sequence @code{binfmt_misc} will look for file
recognition.

The magic string may contain hex--encoded characters like @code{\x0a} or
@code{\xA4}.  When echoing the record from a shell environment, we will
have to quote the backslash: @code{\\x0a}.

If we chose filename extension matching, this is the extension to be
recognised (without the @code{.}, the @code{\x0a} specials are not
allowed).  Extension matching is case sensitive.

@item mask
It is a bitmask.  We can mask out some bits from matching by supplying a
string with the same length of @code{magic}.  The mask is ANDed with the
byte sequence from the file.  It defaults to @code{0xff}.

@item interpreter
It is the program that should be invoked with the binary as first
argument.  @strong{We have to specify the full path.}
@end table

There are some restrictions:

@itemize
@item
The whole @file{register} string may not exceed 255 characters.

@item
The magic must reside in the first @math{128} bytes of the file, i.e.
@code{offset+size(magic)} has to be less than @math{128}.

@item
The interpreter string may not exceed @math{127} characters.
@end itemize

@appendixsec Using the mechanism


We may want to add the binary formats in one of the shell scripts that
are executed at system boot time.  For example, on a Slackware Linux
system we can use @file{/etc/rc.d/rc.local}.

To do it we can add to the shell script a chunk of code like the
following, which activates the mechanism for Scheme programs compiled
with @value{PRJNAME}:

@example
if test -f /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
then
  if test -f /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/VICARE
  then echo -1 >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/VICARE
  fi
  echo \
   ':VICARE:M:0:;;;!vicare::/usr/local/bin/vicare:' \
   >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
fi
@end example

@noindent
which does the following:

@enumerate
@item
Verify if the @code{binfmt_misc} kernel module has been loaded by
testing the existence of the @file{register} file; if the module is not
there, nothing happens.

@item
Remove the configuration from the registry if it is already there; this
is done by testing the existence of the special file:

@example
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/VICARE
@end example

@noindent
echoing @code{-1} in it removes the @value{PRJNAME} record.

@item
echo the @value{PRJNAME} record into the registry with the following fields:

@table @code
@item VICARE
It is the name of the special file representing the record in the
registry.

@item M
Activates first bytes recognition.

@item 0
The offset of the magic string into the file.

@item ;;;!vicare
The magic string itself.

@item /usr/local/bin/vicare
The full pathname to the @value{PRJNAME} runtime system executable.
@end table
@end enumerate

We see that the @code{mask} field is set to the empty string, that is:
no mask is applied and @code{#!vicare} is matched literally.

We have to care about the order of added entries: entries added later
are matched first.

@c page
@node binfmt control
@appendixsec Controlling the mechanism


@subsubheading Overall control

We can enable/disable the mechanism by echoing @code{0} (to disable) or
@code{1} (to enable) to the special file:

@example
/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status
@end example

@noindent
that is, at the shell prompt and with superuser privileges, to enable:

@example
# echo 1 >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status
@end example

@noindent
and to disable:

@example
# echo 0 >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status
@end example

Applying the command @command{cat} to the @file{status} special file
tells us the current status of @code{binfmt_misc}:

@example
$ cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status
enabled
@end example

We can remove all the entries from the registry echoing @code{-1} to
@file{status}; at the shell prompt and with superuser privileges:

@example
# echo -1 >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/status
@end example

@noindent
removing the entries and disabling the mechanism are two distinct
operations.


@subsubheading Specific format control

We can enable/disable recognition of a single binary format by echoing
@code{0} or @code{1} to the format specific special file under
@file{/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc}.  For example for @code{VICARE}, at the
shell prompt and with superuser privileges, to enable:

@example
$ echo 1 >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/VICARE
@end example

@noindent
and to disable:

@example
$ echo 0 >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/VICARE
@end example

@noindent
disabled formats are @strong{not} removed from the internal table.

Applying the command @command{cat} to the format's special file tells us
the current status of that format and its configuration; for example for
@code{VICARE}, at the shell prompt:

@example
$ cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/VICARE
@end example

We can remove a specific format entry from the registry echoing
@code{-1} to its special file; for @code{VICARE} at the shell prompt
and with superuser privileges:

@example
$ echo -1 >/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/VICARE
@end example

@noindent
removing the entry and disabling the mechanism for a format are two
distinct operations.

@appendixsec Hints


If we want to pass command line arguments to the runtime executable, we
must write a wrapper script for it.  There is no way to embed the
arguments in the registry record.

The runtime must @strong{not} look in the @env{PATH} environment
variable for the filename; the kernel passes it the full filename to
use.  Using the @env{PATH} can cause unexpected behaviour and be a
security hazard.

@c page
@node binfmt scheme
@appendixsec Running Scheme programs


The @code{binfmt_misc} mechanism can be used to run both source and
compiled programs.  @value{PRJNAME} adheres to the following rules,
which we can change by customising the files in the distribution:

@enumerate
@item
@value{PRJNAME} source programs are recognised if the file starts with
the string @code{;;;!vicare}.  Notice that we @strong{cannot} use the
sequence @code{#!vicare} because when @code{binfmt_misc} reads the
prefix @code{#!} it activates the traditional shebang processing.

@item
The @code{binfmt_misc} configuration is stored in a Bourne shell script
(@file{/bin/sh} interpreter) named @file{rc.vicare-scheme} installed in
the @code{$(sysconfdir)/rc.d} directory.  If the default configuration
is not changed, this ends up being:

@example
/usr/local/etc/rc.d/rc.vicare-scheme
@end example

The script can be executed at system boot time and again later any
number of times: at each run it resets and reinitialises the
configuration for Scheme programs.

@item
The @command{vicare} executable must be in @code{$(bindir)}, else we
must customise the @file{rc.vicare-scheme} script.
