;;;; symbol table data structure

;;A SYMBOL-TABLE  structure is, in  practice, a hash table  holding weak
;;references to  interned symbols.  When the number  of interned symbols
;;equals the number of buckets (whatever the distribution), the table is
;;enlarged  doubling  the  number   of  buckets.   The  table  is  never
;;restricted by reducing the number of buckets.
;;
;;Constructor: make-symbol-table SIZE MASK VECTOR GUARDIAN
;;
;;Predicate: symbol-table? OBJ
;;
;;Field name: size
;;Accessor: symbol-table-size TABLE
;;Mutator: set-symbol-table-size! TABLE
;;  The number of symbols interned  in the table.  The maximum number of
;;  interned symbols is the greatest fixnum.
;;
;;Field name: mask
;;Accessor: symbol-table-mask TABLE
;;Mutator: set-symbol-table-mask! TABLE
;;  A bitmask used to convert a  symbol's hash number into an index into
;;  the vector in the VEC field as follows:
;;
;;    (define index ($fxlogand mask (symbol-hash symbol)))
;;
;;Field name: buckets
;;Accessor: symbol-table-buckets TABLE
;;Mutator: set-symbol-table-buckets! TABLE
;;  Actual collection of interned symbols, this is the vector of buckets
;;  of the  hash table.  Each  element in the  vector is a list  of weak
;;  pairs holding  the interned symbols.  The maximum  number of buckets
;;  is half the greatest fixnum.
;;
;;Field name: guardian
;;Accessor: symbol-table-guardian TABLE
;;Mutator: set-symbol-table-guardian! TABLE
;;  A guardian  in which interned  symbols are registered.   Whenever an
;;  interned symbol is garbage  collected, the guardian extracts it from
;;  the table.
;;
;;  FIXME The guardian is scanned  for symbols to be uninterned whenever
;;  a new symbol is interned.

;;4096.  (Marco Maggi; Oct 31, 2011)
