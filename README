1. Introduction
---------------

Scheme is  a statically scoped  and properly tail--recursive
dialect  of the  Lisp programming  language invented  by Guy
Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman.  It was designed to
have  an exceptionally  clear and  simple semantics  and few
different ways to form expressions.

  The "Revised^6 Report  on the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
gives  a defining  description of  the  programming language
Scheme.  The report is the work of many people in the course
of  many years; revision  6 was  edited by  Michael Sperber,
R. Kent Dybvig, Matthew Flatt and Anton Van Straaten.

  Ikarus is  an almost R6RS compliant  implementation of the
Scheme programming language; it is the creation of Abdulaziz
Ghuloum.

  Vicare  (pronounced the etruscan  way) is  an experimental
fork of Ikarus Scheme which  aims at fixing bugs and enhance
some features like the POSIX interface.


1.1 Policy
----------

While the long term aim  of the project is still not clearly
established,  Vicare  has the  following  short and  midterm
goals:

4. Install
----------

If you have checked out  a revision from the repository, you
will have to build  the infrastructure running a script from
the top source directory:

   $ cd /path/to/vicare
   $ sh BUILD-THE-INFRASTRUCTURE.sh

after that, basically we should do:

   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/vicare


5. Testing
----------

Running:

   $ make check

will run the test suite.


A. Credits
----------

The  origina Ikarus  Scheme code  is the  work  of Abdulaziz
Ghuloum.  Vicare is a fork driven by Marco Maggi.
