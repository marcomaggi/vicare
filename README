1. Introduction
---------------

Scheme is  a statically scoped  and properly tail--recursive  dialect of
the  Lisp programming  language invented  by  Guy Lewis  Steele Jr.  and
Gerald Jay Sussman.  It was  designed to have an exceptionally clear and
simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.

  The  "Revised^6 Report  on the  Algorithmic Language  Scheme"  gives a
defining description of the  programming language Scheme.  The report is
the work  of many  people in the  course of  many years; revision  6 was
edited by Michael  Sperber, R. Kent Dybvig, Matthew  Flatt and Anton Van
Straaten.

  Ikarus Scheme is an almost R6RS compliant implementation of the Scheme
programming  language; it is  the creation  of Abdulaziz  Ghuloum, which
retired from  development in 2010.   Vicare Scheme is an  R6RS compliant
fork of Ikarus Scheme, aiming to  become a native compiler for R6 Scheme
producing  single   threaded  programs  running  on   Intel  x86  32-bit
processors, with experimental support  for 64-bit machines.  "Vicare" is
pronounced the etruscan way.

4. Install
----------

After checking out a revision from the repository, we will have to build
the infrastructure running a script from the top source directory:

   $ cd /path/to/vicare
   $ sh BUILD-THE-INFRASTRUCTURE.sh

after  that, or  if we  have downloaded  a proper  distribution tarball,
basically we should do:

   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/vicare


5. Testing
----------

Test  files  are  located  in  the "tests"  directory;  the  files  with
extension  ".sps" are  Scheme  programs.  They  are  partitioned in  two
families: the files whose name  start with "long-test" need some time to
be executed  by a  powerless computer; the  files whose name  start with
"test" can  be run in  reasonable time on  any system.  The  files whose
name contains "r6rs" are R6RS compliance tests by Matthew Flatt.

  The "make check",  "make test" and "make tests"  commands run the same
set of  "quick" tests; the "check"  makefile rule uses  the GNU Automake
infrastructure.

  The "make long-test"  and "make long-tests" commands run  the same set
of time-consuming tests.

  It  is possible  to select  a  single test  file by  using the  "file"
variable on the command line of "make"; for example:

   $ make test file=equal-hash

will run the  "test-issue-001-equal-hash.sps" file.  The "file" variable
is used to expand a file name with wildcards as in "test-*$(file)*.sps".

  It  is possible to  run "vicare"  from the  build directory  with user
selected command line arguments doing:

   $ make test-run user_flags='...'

where the contents  of the "user_flags" variable are  placed directly on
the command line.

  Some  test  files need  a  usable  directory  pathname in  the  TMPDIR
environment variable.

  The  file "test-vicare-posix.sps" contains  tests for  network sockets
which are  normally disabled because  the firewall rules on  the hosting
machine must  allo connections on 127.0.0.1:8080  and 127.0.0.1:8081; to
enable these tests run make with the environment variable RUN_INET_TESTS
set to something:

   $ make test file=vicare-posix RUN_INET_TESTS=1
