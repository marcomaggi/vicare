1. Introduction
---------------

Scheme is  a statically scoped  and properly tail--recursive  dialect of
the  Lisp programming  language invented  by  Guy Lewis  Steele Jr.  and
Gerald Jay Sussman.  It was  designed to have an exceptionally clear and
simple semantics and few different ways to form expressions.

  The  "Revised^6 Report  on the  Algorithmic Language  Scheme"  gives a
defining description of the  programming language Scheme.  The report is
the work  of many  people in the  course of  many years; revision  6 was
edited by Michael  Sperber, R. Kent Dybvig, Matthew  Flatt and Anton Van
Straaten.

  Ikarus Scheme is an almost R6RS compliant implementation of the Scheme
programming language;  it is the creation of  Abdulaziz Ghuloum.  Vicare
Scheme is  an experimental  fork of Ikarus  Scheme which aims  at fixing
bugs and  enhance some  features like the  POSIX interface;  "Vicare" is
pronounced the etruscan way.


1.1 Policy
----------

While the long term aim of the project is still not clearly established,
Vicare has the following short and midterm goals:

* Allow the installation  of both Ikarus and Vicare  without conflict in
  installed files and directories.

* Drop documentation in TeX format, replacing it with a Texinfo file.

* Document the  internals of the source distribution,  both the building
  infrastructure and the source code.

* Fix bugs.

* Accept patches which improve compliance  with the R6RS report, with an
  eye to pragmatism and "programs that work".

* Accept patches to expose the POSIX interface at the Scheme level.

* Reject big and revolutionary patches.


1.2 Contributing
----------------

If you  feel the need to  contribute bug reports, bug  fixes, patches or
documentation to  Vicare Scheme, you  are welcome.  For bug  reports and
patches, you should adhere to the following rules:

* Vicare  is hosted  at  GitHub, so  first  of all  an  issue should  be
  registered at the development site:

                 <http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/>

  so  that a  new branch  can be  created in  the repository,  with name
  referring to the issue.

* The branch which aims at enhancing the original Ikarus distribution is
  named "ikarus", so a patch should be built by deriving the code from a
  checkout of such branch.

  For  documentation contributions,  you can  contact  directly Vicare's
maintainer  at <marco.maggi-ipsu@poste.it>  with or  without  opening an
issue abount undocumented features.

4. Install
----------

If you have checked out a revision from the repository, you will have to
build the infrastructure running a script from the top source directory:

   $ cd /path/to/vicare
   $ sh BUILD-THE-INFRASTRUCTURE.sh

after that, basically we should do:

   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the  "DESTDIR" environment variable to install
the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/vicare


5. Testing
----------

Running:

   $ make check

will run the test suite.


A. Credits
----------

The origina Ikarus Scheme code is the work of Abdulaziz Ghuloum.  Vicare
Scheme is a fork driven by Marco Maggi.
