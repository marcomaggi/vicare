This directory contains the Gambit benchmarks and benchmarking
infrastructure, written by Marc Feeley.  Will Clinger has
hacked it up to run benchmarks on the machines used by the
Larceny project, and has added several benchmarks beyond
those distributed with Gambit.

Additional files and directories:

    summarize.sch   ; Scheme code for summarizing results
    summarize2.sch  ; Scheme code for generating HTML of results
    results.*       ; outputs of the bench script
    Results         ; a place to move results.* files

To summarize results:

    % larceny
    > (load "summarize.sch")
    > ((summarize larceny-results) "results.Larceny")
    > ((summarize mzscheme-results) "results.MzScheme")

An output file can be specified as an optional argument.

To generate HTML bar graphs of summarized results:

    % larceny
    > (load "summarize.sch")
    > (load "summarize2.sch")
    > (define summaries (decode-usual-suspects))
    > (graph-benchmarks summaries "temp1")

See the definition of decode-usual-suspects in summarize.sch.
There is also a decode-usual-suspects-linux.
