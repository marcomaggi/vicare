People listed in this file have contributed comments, suggestions,
criticisms,  and bug reports which have helped me fix and improve
Ikarus Scheme.  Without their contributions, my job would've been
much harder.  I'm very thankful.

====================================================================
VERSION 0.0.2:

- Everybody who took the time to email me when Ikarus was released.
  Thanks for the encouragements.

- Eric Hanchrow (offby1) reported the first public bug on bignum
  division error

- Wolfram Fenske helped test porting the system to NetBSD and
  FreeBSD, increasing the number of supported platforms from 3 to 5.
  The Solaris port is still unfinished though.

- Tom Gordon reported installation problems on 64-bit systems which
  resulted in improving the error report of the configure script.

- Jens Axel SÃ¸gaard(and his brother) provided solutions for
  compiling Ikarus on 64-bit machines.

- Andre van Tonder reported expansion problems for top-level
  programs.  He also made suggestions for improving the user's
  guide.

- Michael Adams helped in a zillion things including fixing typos,
  making the command-line procedure consistent for scripts and
  interactive sessions, installing the boot file in a proper
  location (along with some help in using automake and autoconf),
  filed bug reports (on expt, modulo, error, get-line,
  number->string, truncate, fltruncate, flabs, substring,
  define-record-type, put-u8, the expander, and the compiler), and
  helped cut startup time in half by instrumenting the ikarus
  loader.

- Phil Bewig wrote SRFI-41 (streams) in R6RS, which loads flawlessly
  in Ikarus.

- Felix Klock reported (indirectly) that the +nan.0 and +inf.0
  should be case insensitive.

- Derick Eddington reported garbage collection problems with code
  that only uses bignum arithmetic.  Also reported problems with
  reading identifiers containing unicode escape sequences and
  corrected a minor bug with export classifications.

- Kent Dybvig approved of an idea for optimizing closures that
  resulted in cutting the bootstrap time in half.

- Will Clinger indirectly reported that Ikarus does not support the
  #!r6rs comment.


====================================================================
VERSION 0.0.1:

- Kent Dybvig and Michael Adams both advised that the initial
  release should build and install using the standard ./configure,
  make, make install sequence.   This made the lauch of Ikarus very
  successful as people had little or no problems building and
  installing it.  

- Will Byrd gave suggestions about the minimum stuff that should go
  into the user's guide and suggested having a small R6RS tutorial.

- Roshan James bugged me to port Ikarus to Windows.  Only half of
  his wish came true (cygwin is not windows in his dictionary).
