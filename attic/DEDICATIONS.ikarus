Ikarus is dedicated to the people who made Ikarus possible.

To my advisor Kent Dybvig, 
  for teaching me everything he knew about compilers, and 
  for making Chez Scheme: an example to be followed.

To my wife Ghaidaa,
  for persevering with me during the hardships, and
  for the thousands of hacking hours that she allowed for.

To my parents,
  for waiting, patiently, for their son in his voluntary 
  exile.
