Subject: [announce] Vicare Scheme revision 0.2d2

                             Vicare Scheme
                             =============


Vicare Scheme is an R6RS compliant fork of Ikarus Scheme, aiming to be a
native compiler for R6 Scheme producing single threaded programs running
on  Intel x86  32-bit processors;  Vicare  is officially  not ready  for
64-bit machines.  "Vicare" is pronounced the etruscan way.

  The latest version of this package can be downloaded from Github:

            <http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/downloads>

the home page of the Vicare project is at:

               <http://marcomaggi.github.com/vicare.html>

development takes place at:

                 <http://github.com/marcomaggi/vicare/>

this project has a mailing list:

	     <http://groups.google.com/group/vicare-users>

  It  is suggested to  use Vicare  Scheme along  with Nausicaa,  a large
collection of R6 Scheme libraries:

Notes for revision 0.2d2
------------------------

* Tarballs extracted from GitHub's  "extract tagged revision" feature do
  not work because of missing files,  so this project is back on relying
  only  on  full repository  checkouts  and  release  tarballs from  the
  download area.

* The  default   list  of  library   file  extensions  now   holds  just
  ".vicare.sls" and ".sls"; the new option --more-file-extensions allows
  to restore  the old  behaviour of searching  for many  file extensions
  plus the "main" file trick.

* Some documentation has been written; other reviewed.

* More code reviewed with support for optional arguments validation.

* Updated  functions to  properly rely  on I/O  port's own  buffer mode;
  DISPLAY, WRITE, NEWLINE do not force a flush anymore.

* Added  SET-PORT-BUFFER-MODE! to  reconfigure the  mode of  an existing
  port.


Notes for revision 0.2d1
------------------------

* It  appears that  Ikarus' mailing  list is  working no  more,  so this
  project  now   has  its  own   mailing  list  for   announcements  and
  discussions:

	     <http://groups.google.com/group/vicare-users>

* Added library (vicare) exporting the same bindings of (ikarus).

* Review of bytevector functions.

* Introduced  the configuration  option "--disable-arguments-validation"
  to exclude  at expansion-time code validating  arguments to functions.
  At present only a few modules support this feature.

* Review  of command line  options and  execution modes.   Added options
  "--print-assembly"  and "--print-optimizer",  at present  neither very
  useful, nor human-friendly.
